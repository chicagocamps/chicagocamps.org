          <h2>UX Camp: Home Edition is a 1-day mini-conference for all things UX. From where ever you are&mdash;be that a deck, patio, kitchen table, couch with someone crawling all over you, or some place close enough to someone else&#8217;s wifi to make it free to access (and far enough away to not be creepy).</h2>
          <p>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading downtown Chicago for some (hopefully) nice weather, great views, city sounds, and then the abundant food and snacks that we like to provide.</p>
          <p>Things are different now, and we want to do something that is great for our community, spreads to the broader community, and still provides opportunity for presenters to present and attendees to learn. We&#8217;re giving this a shot, and we hope you&#8217;ll give us a shot, too!</p>
          <p>Spend the day getting immersed in what&#8217;s happening in the UX design and development space, and leave bursting with new ideas and insights. And if we&#8217;re able to do this right, we&#8217;ll make sure all this glorious content gets shared online, as well.</p>
          <p>Grab a ticket, or &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221; and buy some tickets to help someone else attend if you can afford to pay a little love and learning forward.</p>
          <p>One last thing: Buy a UX Camp: Home Edition ($12) and weâ€™ll add a ticket to our &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221; ticket pool. You get to look good, and feel good!</p>

          <!-- %h3 Research your Team First: Key Communication Techniques to Build Trust &amp; Clarity in Product Teams -->
          <!-- %p Instead of trying to &#8220;win&#8221; an argument, what if we invested in understanding our counterparts&#8217; and stakeholders&#8217; needs first with the goal of building their trust? We are passionate about our work, and in collaborative environments, we need to align our differing views of user needs, innovative ideas, and product vision across disciplines and management levels. This often means we spend a lot of time pitching our concepts for adoption into a product roadmap. -->
          <!-- %p In this talk, you will learn communication techniques to uncover the key problems that cross-functional teams can rally around. We will also cover how to apply these techniques to help our teams feel more prepared for conversations about project scope, priority shifts, and even work-place conflicts. -->

              <h3>The 10 Principles of Effective Wireframes</h3>
              <p>Wireframing should be a part of every digital design project and each team should have a hand in making them. You don&#8217;t even need a computer to create great wireframesâ€”a sketch on a white board works just as well if you&#8217;re doing it right. And what is doing it right? I&#8217;ve identified 10 principles that can help make the daily life of working on digital products a bit easier.</p>
              <p>There are lots of teams working together to create products, however only one seems to properly communicate to everyone visually: The design team. We all encounter problems in our everyday life and there are times when we devise solutions to fix those problems, and that is a design. And that, indeed, makes us all designers. In this presentation, I will explore why everyone should wireframe and tips on how to make the wireframing process a collaborative success.</p>

              <h3>Design for Interaction: Using Animation to Enhance User Experience</h3>
              <p>Modern browsers, JavaScript libraries, and CSS3 have made it easier than ever to create exciting, dynamic animated experiences within web interfaces. But we have also seen the unfortunate side effect of trying to do too much: websites that are resource hogs, eating up bandwidth and slowing load times to a crawl, all for effects that are ultimately just there for the &#8220;show&#8221; factor.</p>
              <p>This talk will discuss how to use these animation skills for good: to establish context, convey status, give feedback, and yes, even add a little delight. Along the way, we&#8217;ll discuss the principles of animation that guide everything from your favorite feature films to the actions of a button on your screen, and learn how deliberate animation choices can improve the experience for your user. We will also touch on the available tools in JS and CSS and how to choose which one is the right one for your animation task.</p>
