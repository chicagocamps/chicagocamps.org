          </h2>
          <p><strong>On Thursday &amp; Friday, August  6th &amp; 7th, from where ever you are</strong>&mdash;since we&#8217;re not going to be in our space, let&#8217;s meet in yours! We&#8217;ll have a day of abbreviated design leadership presentations, thoughtful Q&amp;A, and an optional workshop that allow you to gain a lot of insightful learning.</p>
          <p><strong>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago</strong> including all of these wonderful speakers. We&#8217;re used to amazing views, great coffees, too many snacks, and a lot of local Chicago-area food goodness. Since we can&#8217;t do that, and we don&#8217;t want our amazing speakers to miss out on that, we&#8217;re going to postpone our full sessions until 2021, and these teasers should make sure we all get enough of a taste to hold us over until then.</p>
          <p><strong>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing:</strong></p>
          <ul class='list-ul'>

              <h3>Building Compound Designers Workshop Description</h3>
              <p>It&#8217;s useful for researchers to have a thorough understanding of the ideation process, because the ideation is going to be structured around the research findings and deliverables, which will be the result of specifically crafted research protocols. It&#8217;s equally as important for these researchers to have an awareness of Content Strategy, so that they can capture specific details in their research that can lead to an understanding of the how people use language to work through the problem space. Interface designers who can meaningfully interpret the provenance of research findings will be able to preserve the intent of strategic decisions when they run into a snag resulting from bringing abstract concepts into our dimensional world full of very real limitations.</p>
              <p>Too often, design and designers exist in isolation. They will work on one part of the greater whole, be very good at that one thing, and then come to your company and suddenly something doesn&#8217;t quite click. Now when you&#8217;ve got ten or fifty, or four hundred designers who&#8217;ve worked at various levels of isolation on varied products and services, it can take a long time to get everyone on the same page. Design firms like Adaptive Path would specifically seek out designers who were t-shaped where the bar of the t was equally as developed as the stem. This very intentional generalism was useful for a number of reasons, but one that really stands out is that these designers have an ingrained awareness of how each part of the design process supports and relates to every other phase of the project. This workshop is the result of the need for these strong t-bars in a hiring environment based on keyword searches and hyper-specialization. It focuses on the cause and effect of different inputs, tools, and techniques, why they matter, and how they&#8217;re useful for all of the other parts of the process of building meaningful experiences for messy humans in complex circumstances.</p>
