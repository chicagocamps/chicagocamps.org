            <strong>Leadership by Design: Home Edition</strong>.
          </h2>
          <p><strong>On Thursday &amp; Friday, August  6th &amp; 7th, from where ever you are</strong>&mdash;since we&#8217;re not going to be in our space, let&#8217;s meet in yours! We&#8217;ll have a day of abbreviated design leadership presentations, thoughtful Q&amp;A, and an optional workshop that allow you to gain a lot of insightful learning.</p>
          <p><strong>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago</strong> including all of these wonderful speakers. We&#8217;re used to amazing views, great coffees, too many snacks, and a lot of local Chicago-area food goodness. Since we can&#8217;t do that, and we don&#8217;t want our amazing speakers to miss out on that, we&#8217;re going to postpone our full sessions until 2021, and these teasers should make sure we all get enough of a taste to hold us over until then.</p>
          <p><strong>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing:</strong></p>
          <ul class='list-ul'>
            <li>The first 20 tickets to Leadership By Design: Home Edition for only $5!</li>
            <li>The rest of the tickets to Leadership By Design: Home Edition are only $10!</li>
            <li>Workshop tickets are only $15! (Only 50 available!)</li>
            <li>We&#8217;re also offering <strong>&#8220;Pay What You Can&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;Need 1, Take 1&#8221;</strong> (free) options, as well</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>And we&#8217;ve got a pretty swanky t-shirt, brought to you in collaboration with our pals at Nerditees:</strong></p>
          <div class='grid' style='text-align: center;'>
            <img alt="Leadership by Design: Home Edition black t-shirt" class="grid-1-3" src="/assets/img/events/swag/lbd-2020-black.png" />

          </div>
          <p>For $12, you can get your choice of color and size shipped directly to you, and we&#8217;ll add an additional &#8220;Need 1, Take 1&#8221; ticket to the pool.</p>

              <h3>Hunting for Your Dinner: Finding Opportunities &amp; Adding Value in Wicked Times</h3>
              <p>Designers have always had to be creative and thoughtful about finding their next project, job, or opportunity. Any illusions of control we had disappeared when the pandemic struck. We have always lived in an uncertain world.</p>
              <p>Not everyone can do what you do. Think about how to use your skills to seek out places to help in your organization. Your cunning, creativity, and willingness to experiment are critical to aiding companies looking to navigate, survive, and hopefully thrive beyond today&#8217;s crisis. I&#8217;ll focus on a few small but scalable approaches around mingling and triage to help you design new responsibilities. Think about what problems you are uniquely suited to help solve, identify places where you can use your skills, and, most importantly, look at the variety of ways you can add value. Reframe, review, revisit, invert, and explore how we work, support each other, and help our clients and customers.</p>

              <h3>Betazoid Leadership in a Locked Down Federation</h3>
              <p><em>&#8220;To admit that you&#8217;re afraid gives you strength.&#8221;</em> &mdash; Counselor Troi to Lieutenant Worf (Star Trek: TNG)</p>
              <p>As a leader, being/feeling/appearing vulnerable can be uncomfortable and make us doubt ourselves. Strong emotions aren&#8217;t typically on display in work environments. That hasn&#8217;t necessarily been the case since the world has flipped upside down. Many of us are working from home full time, for the first time. Seeing your coworkers in their homes on video conferences is surprisingly humanizing. More so than when they are working from home and calling into a conference at work. Seeing every person you work with, their homes, pets, kids, hobbies (i.e. guitars on the wall, knitting projects in the background), makes everyone a little more human. A little more vulnerable.</p>
              <p>How can we, as leaders, provide our teams with the compassionate, empathetic support they need in times of difficulty, while also taking care of ourselves? In this talk, I&#8217;ll focus on strategies to ensure you&#8217;re providing thoughtful leadership to your team, and help your own leadership understand you and your team&#8217;s needs.</p>

              <h3>Storytelling as a UX Leadership Superpower</h3>
              <p>We know that, as designers mature, they need to understand how to tell a story about their work. But how do you coach them in storytelling when stories can take so many forms depending on the phase of a project? In this presentation, Dani Nordin of athenahealth will share a framework she&#8217;s created to help designers at athenahealth craft a compelling story at various phases of a project&mdash;from design scenarios to research plans to portfolio case studies.</p>
              <p>You&#8217;ll learn:</p>
              <ul class='list-ul'>
                <li>The fundamental types of stories that tend to show up in our work;</li>
                <li>How the elements, attitude and altitude with which we shape our stories impact their effectiveness;</li>
                <li>Common pitfalls to avoid when crafting your story.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Along the way, you&#8217;ll laugh, cry and see some cute animal pictures.</p>

              <h3>Leading With Discomfort</h3>
              <p>Originally I&#8217;d planned to discuss the systems that keep HubSpot&#8217;s 120 person UX team focused on the right things for our customers. Then the world tilted back in March, and 2020 has served up a series of unprecedented obstacles.</p>
              <p>So how did those systems fare under the extreme pressure test of working with needy pets, homeschooled kids, and a constant thrum of anxiety and grief? So far, it turns out that leaning into these challenges with vulnerability and transparency proved to be our greatest leadership tool, and our culture is our most important &#8220;system&#8221; of all. I&#8217;ll share how external turmoil has shaped my framework for allocating leadership attention across infrastructure, process, culture, impact, and vision. Sometimes you have to fall apart to truly come together.</p>

              <h3>Beyond Tactical Onboarding: What Every Designer Needs to Know to be Successful</h3>
              <p>Good design leaders know that designers must think beyond the interface and user needs and work on the business, not just in the business. We ask them to balance business needs, to design with intentionality, and make appropriate trade offs given the complex ecosystems that surround our organizations and their industries.  We focus so much on hiring for tactical craft skills, but it&#8217;s the ability to be strategic within an organization&#8217;s business context that makes our design team members truly effective.</p>
              <p>In this talk, we will learn how to conduct activities from day 1 to help designers understand the industry better, to apply critical thinking to their choices, and start working more strategically. I will share how, at Roadmunk, we use frameworks like Porter&#8217;s 5 Forces and Blue Ocean Strategy as part of our design onboarding process. This allows new hires to not only get acquainted with our industry, but to form early relationships with other departments, and hit the ground running.</p>

              <h3>Building Compound Designers Workshop Description</h3>
              <p>It&#8217;s useful for researchers to have a thorough understanding of the ideation process, because the ideation is going to be structured around the research findings and deliverables, which will be the result of specifically crafted research protocols. It&#8217;s equally as important for these researchers to have an awareness of Content Strategy, so that they can capture specific details in their research that can lead to an understanding of the how people use language to work through the problem space. Interface designers who can meaningfully interpret the provenance of research findings will be able to preserve the intent of strategic decisions when they run into a snag resulting from bringing abstract concepts into our dimensional world full of very real limitations.</p>
              <p>Too often, design and designers exist in isolation. They will work on one part of the greater whole, be very good at that one thing, and then come to your company and suddenly something doesn&#8217;t quite click. Now when you&#8217;ve got ten or fifty, or four hundred designers who&#8217;ve worked at various levels of isolation on varied products and services, it can take a long time to get everyone on the same page. Design firms like Adaptive Path would specifically seek out designers who were t-shaped where the bar of the t was equally as developed as the stem. This very intentional generalism was useful for a number of reasons, but one that really stands out is that these designers have an ingrained awareness of how each part of the design process supports and relates to every other phase of the project. This workshop is the result of the need for these strong t-bars in a hiring environment based on keyword searches and hyper-specialization. It focuses on the cause and effect of different inputs, tools, and techniques, why they matter, and how they&#8217;re useful for all of the other parts of the process of building meaningful experiences for messy humans in complex circumstances.</p>
