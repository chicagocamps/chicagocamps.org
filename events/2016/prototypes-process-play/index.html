              <h3>Ethical by Design</h3>
              <p>Every business is now unique in their faith in experimentation, evidence, and iteration. Done right, it&#8217;s a healthy, focused approach. Done poorly, it becomes twisted into absurd scientism: numbers trump all, and users are reduced to mere statistics.</p>
              <p>Digital technology&#8217;s unprecedented scale brings serious ethical responsibility. How can we balance data-driven approaches with empathy and humanity? How do we help companies see users as more than means to achieve company goals? And how do we ensure our decisions benefit not only ourselves but our wider communities and the world at large?</p>

While he&#8217;s not worrying about staying relevant, he writes about pens, bridges, people, poker, and werewolves at the popular weblog, Rands in Repose. He works as the head of engineering at Pinterest in San Francisco where he&#8217;s furiously working on helping humans curate their inspiration.</p>
              <p>Michael has written two books. His first book &#8220;Managing Humans, 2nd Edition&#8221; is a popular guide to the art of engineering leadership and clearly explains that while you be rewarded for what you build, you will only be successful because of your people. His second book &#8220;Being Geek&#8221; is a career handbook for geeks and nerds alike.</p>
              <p>Michael plays mountain bikes, tinkers with drones, and drinks red wine in the redwoods of Northern California whenever he can because staying sane is more important than staying busy.</p>

              <p>Adam Connor is a designer, author and illustrator based in Western Massachusetts. As VP of Organizational Design at Mad*Pow, Adam creates positive change in organizations by addressing the relationships that people have with one another to foster more collaborative, creative, and human-centric organizations.</p>
              <p>Adam and his team examine organizations&#8217; behaviors and culture, looking closely at all the ways that they are expressed and reinforced. They explore how beliefs and perceptions influence things like roles, structure, processes, and tools that organizations use every day. They then work collaboratively with teams to identify changes to improve people&#8217;s capacity to work together in meaningful ways that allow them to deliver valuable products and services to their audience.</p>

              <h3>Building Creative, Collaborative Cultures</h3>
              <p>Organizations are taking a strong interest in design &#8212; realizing that understanding the needs, expectations and contexts in which people interact and use products and services leads not only to improvements in their current offerings, but ideas and opportunities for new innovations. With this realization has come immense investment in design talent and training. But having design talent and creativity does not ensure success. Design is not just a new tool to add to a growing collection. As these skills and individuals are added to the mix in many teams, both designers and non-designers alike often struggle to work together and produce great work.</p>
              <p>Design is a shift in mindset that influences how we behave and make decisions. In order for organizations to make use of design they must be set up to do so. In this presentation we&#8217;ll look at the characteristics and cultures of organizations that are able to effectively create, collaborate on, and produce great design and explore strategies to foster innovation by building better teams, helping them use new tools to work together, identify problems and break down silos that stop progress.</p>

              <h3>Designer in the Machine</h3>
              <p>Big organizations have a reputation as stifling and lonely places where design careers sputter. The structure required to become successful on a large scale traditionally left little room for creative exploration. These places are awakening to the value of design. They are looking to designers to transform their cubicled caverns into design led enterprises. Changing culture is hard, especially when you bring people who think differently together. But we already have the skills to get this done. Using the same user centered tactics that we use to design products and services, designers are creating change. Gail will show how to extend design thinking, empathy, and collaboration to thrive as a designer and be a happy part of something big.</p>

              <h3>Careers by Design</h3>
              <p>We spend a great deal of time talking about design language, design tools, and technological developments and trends, but relatively little on planning and nurturing our careers. Maybe this gap is because there is not a good &#8220;language&#8221; to help us talk about career planning and aid in managing these discussions.</p>
              <p>Ian has been working on a framework to help employees define, design, monitor, and grow their careers. The primary goal of the framework is to establish a broad set of guidelines to assist managers as they support employees. It is useful for people who want to focus on one core skill, as well as those interested in more multi-disciplinary roles or (eventually) management.</p>

              <p>As organizations continue to establish and mature their in-house design teams, it turns out there&#8217;s very little common wisdom on what makes for a successful design organization.

She will share stories on the benefits and challenges of working in both consulting and in-house, and will leave you with practical tips to build and lead your design teams and organization.</p>

              <h3>Frameworks of Feedback</h3>
              <p>Design and code reviews, retros, and performance reviews &#8212; all acknowledge the importance of communication and feedback and they are a good start. But they don&#8217;t tell you how to give negative feedback or ensure that you, as a teammate or manager, hear the small things before they become big things.</p>
              <p>Let&#8217;s talk about feedback and examine frameworks for how to ask for and frame feedback effectively. Not all situations call for the same type of feedback and some are more sensitive than others. We will look at Non-violent communication, techniques from family and marriage therapy, as well as more traditional frameworks for feedback.</p>

              <p>Tanseela leads the design research and universal design efforts at United Airlines. The research team informs the vision, experience and execution of inspiring, useful, and profitable travel products and services. The accessibility team ensures universal design throughout design and development cycle.</p>
              <p>In her three years at United, she has successfully positioned design research, and its methods, as the means of centering the user in the business and design development process to ensure viability, desirability, and usefulness of a feature or product.</p>
              <p>With over 16 years of design research experience, the questions that strive to uncover and understand the underlying motivations of people, why do they do what they do, never gets old. These are the things that drive behavior. She uses this understanding to start conversations that will ultimately lead to improved experiences.</p>
              <h3>Design Researcher as (the most) Super (of all) Heroes</h3>
              <p>What do Deadpool, Superman, Elastic Man, Mr. Mxyzptlk, Multiple Man and a Design Researcher have in common? Super powers!</p>
              <p>Yes, Design Researchers have super powers, and they may be the best super hero of them all! While most super heroes have only one or two powers, immortality, x-ray vision, elasticity, re-animation and replication are all super powers of the Design Researcher. And, these powers are used for good.</p>
