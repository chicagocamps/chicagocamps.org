              <h3>Lessons Learned from the World of Wearables</h3>
              <p>Apple Watch, Fitbit, Jawbone, Misfit&#8230; fitness-related wearables have exploded over the past few years. Their promise, like the promise of many other kinds of wearables: a deeper understanding of personal data and the encouragement to make positive change. How well has this promise been carried out&#8230; and what other kinds of wearables are getting traction?</p>
              <p>In this session Carolyn will share some of the UX lessons learned after working for Chicago wearables start-up, Mira Fitness. We&#8217;ll cover research on the wearables user experience, brand and product differentiation, and common industrial design considerations, as well as some stories from this year&#8217;s Consumer Electronics Show which featured everything from smart clothes to virtual reality headwear.</p>

              <h3>UXers Are from Mars, BAs Are from Venus</h3>
              <p>Looking back at my 15+ year career in user experience, I found that the relationship between UX professionals and business analysts (BAs) is a great indicator of whether a project will be successful or not. This presentation will look at the mutual perception between BA and UX teams, the historical source of their differences, the best ways to start tackling projects together, and why UXers should not loose arguments over design decisions with BAs (this may even have something to do with starting to practice your very own Jedi mind tricks).</p>

              <h3>The Checkbox That Ruined My Life: Exposing Manipulative Design</h3>
              <p>Marketers and experience designers know that subtle nudges toward a specific action can make a huge impact on human behavior. The science of behavior change combined with the emotional drive of good marketing is powerful stuff. But as Spiderman taught us, &#8220;With great power comes great responsibility.&#8221; What does it look like when that power is abused? It might be blatant like a four-screen email opt-out process (Yes, I really do want to unsubscribe). Or it might be subtle like a credit card company pre-checking &#8220;Pay Minimum Due&#8221; on their online payment form. Learn to expose designs that cross the line between persuasion and manipulation and avoid the pitfalls in your own work. #uxhero</p>

              <p>Stumped for design ideas for a screen or a workflow? Want to explore different perspectives? Some of your best resources are your team members. Not just other designers or your Business Analyst, but your developers and project manager. Get the whole team sketching ideas around a specific screen or workflow. Using the design jam technique, it will only take one hour for you to get multiple ideas from different perspectives, and improve team chemistry as well.</p>
              <p>This talk will outline the materials, setup and outline some rules for putting together a design jam. It will also discuss convincing your team to try out the technique. My team loved doing this exercise and would ask to do a design jam when we had a problem we were trying to work out &#8212; Yours will too.</p>

              <h3>Vocal Exercises: Finding Your Voice</h3>
              <p>You often hear about &#8220;writing with one voice&#8221; within an organization. But before you can do that, you have to define that voice. So what does that even mean? How do you do that? And once you do, how can you communicate that to other writers so everyone can &#8220;write with one voice?&#8221;</p>
              <p>In this talk I&#8217;ll walk through:</p>
              <ul class='list-ul'>
                <li>Ideas to facilitate conversations with stakeholders about shaping your voice and tone</li>
                <li>Methods for quickly establishing your voice for users</li>

              <h3>Shaping Signals: Preparing for the Future through Speculative Design</h3>
              <p>What methods can we use to stimulate creativity while considering future ecosystems and challenges? Speculative and Critical Design are approaches that operate within Design Thinking that can be used as tools to surface and address social, cultural, and ethical issues that design for the future can bring. While it&#8217;s been labeled alarmist and sensational, it enables versatile thinking and serves as a platform for discovery, conversation, and awareness that can help fuel different perspectives of the future&#8230;alternate futures, potential futures, some desirable&#8230;some not. It&#8217;s up to us to use these exercises and inspiration to craft the right future built with imagination and responsibility.</p>
              <p>This talk will walk through selected projects that play in the realm of Speculative Design and make the case for how it can be used to understand different challenges the future may hold. Dancing between dystopic futures that address famine and overpopulation to more light-­hearted Design Fiction, we&#8217;ll introduce design lenses that will allow participants to investigate signals in the present, project them into a point in the future, and manifest a product or service with considerations of the state of the future environment.</p>

              <h3>You Too Can Be a Sketching Machine</h3>
              <p>It&#8217;s intimidating to be called out to sketch or draw anything—and even worse when you&#8217;re doing so with people who have the word &#8220;designer&#8221; in their title. Don&#8217;t worry—the confidence you need to put your pencil to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches, you can begin to incorporate sketching into your daily activities. Even better: you can begin to coach others, even non-designers or designers-who-don&#8217;t-really-draw, to use sketching to jumpstart their sketching skills.</p>

              <h3>Wearable Devices &amp; Everyone</h3>
              <p>Wearable devices are still in the &#8220;Wild West&#8221; phase, but we&#8217;re finally starting to learn enough about them that we can start making more intentional decisions. This talk will cover the entire wearable device ecosystem from raw data inputs to prescriptive feedback and emerging behavior change models.</p>

              <h3>How to Guarantee Product Failure</h3>
              <p>Many user experience professionals design screens and flows imagining a user is already bought in, with dashboards full of activity and full friend lists. But getting a user to that point requires a tremendous amount of thought. Onboarding and first time UX represent the most important and most overlooked part of product design, leading to subpar experiences and failed products.</p>
              <p>In this discussion we&#8217;ll do a deep dive into why onboarding matters and discuss dozens of practical tips for getting users to that &#8220;aha&#8221; moment.</p>

              <h3>Curing Design Complacency</h3>
              <p>We may have a design epidemic on our hands: Complacency. Many factors can contribute to becoming complacent as a designer, and fortunately there are numerous ways to push your work beyond &#8220;good enough&#8221;! I&#8217;ve spent many years exploring techniques that can get designers out of their comfort zone and break away from the &#8220;this what we&#8217;ve always done&#8221; mind set. Together, we will walk through the symptoms and discuss treatment options.</p>
              <p>Designers have a greater impact on this world than we realize. Far too often I&#8217;ve seen designers settle for less than what they are capable of. Putting time and effort into a big pile of blah can leave us feeling powerless and unmotivated. Let&#8217;s focus on how to keep pushing past the status quo to create something in which we can all be proud.</p>

              <h3>Sketch-to-Code Prototyping: Moving Faster to Final Designs</h3>
              <p>Prototyping in code, and making use of established pattern libraries, allows UX design teams to have greater control over how their work is executed across devices. This model lets designers do what they do best: think about experiences and interactions, and not the ins and outs of the latest prototyping tool. It also frees designers from having to wait for the development team to see if their designs will work as planned, and can speed time to market by delivering working HTML and CSS to the technical team.</p>
              <p>This talk takes you behind the curtain to see how a real design team is using a sketch-to-code approach to prototyping that gets it to testable responsive designs faster than traditional prototyping approaches. If you&#8217;re looking for ways to add more agility to your design and build process, this talk is for you.</p>
