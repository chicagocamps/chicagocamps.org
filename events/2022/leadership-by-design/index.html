          <p>On Thursday &amp; Friday, September 29th &amp; 30th, from where ever you are. Since we&#8217;re not going to be in our space, let&#8217;s meet in yours! We&#8217;ll have 2 days of stellar keynotes and focused design leadership presentations with thoughtful Q&A that allow you to gain a lot of insightful learning. In addition,each day has an uplifting interstitial that provides a nice break.</p>
          <p>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago-including all of these wonderful speakers. We&#8217;re used to amazing views, great coffees, too many snacks, and a lot of local Chicago-area food goodness. Since we can&#8217;t do that we&#8217;re going to postpone our full sessions until 2023.</p>

              <h3>Ethics &amp; Trust for Emerging Technologies</h3>
              <p>Emerging technologies such as automated vacuums and smart refrigerators are becoming more common in homes, and we all find ourselves conversing regularly with chatbots (whether we want to or not!). As these systems augment humans at work and at play, design teams are challenged with managing the complexity of the interactions, and need to ensure that humans are kept safe and in control. Unfortunately, ethical statements such as &#8220;do no harm&#8221; are simplistic and unhelpful when designing complex interactions.</p>
              <p>Carol will introduce practical approaches that integrate ethical design principles; engage teams in speculative work to proactively identify bias and harms; and help you and your team to focus on supporting users in gaining calibrated trust of these new systems. Strong leadership and facilitation skills are needed to guide teams through these often uncomfortable discussions. Be prepared to guide your team successfully through this important work.</p>

              <p>A former teacher with a knack for advising, Wil has been helping companies develop brand marketing strategies since 1999. As the industry evolved, so has Wil&#8217;s approach. In recent years, Wil has been leading the charge in leveraging “Big Data” to break down silos between SEO, Paid Media, and traditional marketing&mdash;helping clients see the big picture by combining and analyzing data from various sources (even billboards). Wil&#8217;s data-driven approach to consulting helps clients and their teams make better, more strategic, cross-channel decisions and hit the ground running with honest, actionable insights to start generating results and revenue.</p>
              <p>Wil likes helping people too. While data is at the forefront of Wil&#8217;s approach, so is wanting to help others grow and better themselves. Seeing the need for an agency that does good by its team, clients, and community, Wil started Seer Interactive in 2002 as a one-person operation out of his living room. Today, Seer is a remote-first company with offices in Philadelphia and San Diego that employs over 220 people. As Seer&#8217;s VP of Innovation, Wil develops strategies to help clients find opportunities where the typical tools do not. His methods have shaped the search industry worldwide, and he regularly speaks for marketing conferences all around the world. When he&#8217;s not working, you can catch Wil hanging out with his wife Nora, sons Rio and Niko, checking out the best craft beer spots he can find, or keeping up with his running goals.</p>
