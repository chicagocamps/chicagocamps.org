              <h3>Remote Digital Ethnography: Understand Online Dating Behaviors Within the Digital Environment</h3>
              <p>Observing participants can present several challenges, yet still turns out invaluable data that informs our designs—so how in the heck can we observe thoroughly while still maintaining a remote posture? The digital layers of a users&#8217; ecosystem interact to impact their experiences in user experience research today, ethnography should combine the physical and digital planes to understand multiple influences on any one interaction.</p>
              <p>In online dating, there are many contextual elements to consider, including: virtual profiles, messaging, filters to find appropriate matches, use of multiple competitor apps, and geolocation, which create the user&#8217;s online environment. The UX digital landscape combines the context of the physical world plus in-app environment and connected ecosystems. The user&#8217;s environment is primarily digital. The surrounding world is just one plane/layer of consideration in these interactions and digital ethnography can help us understand how to design for these different layers of experience.</p>

              <p>As a designer, Billy is his happiest when designing for a greater purpose. Whether it&#8217;s creating ways for users to enjoy their experience more seamlessly or complete a task more efficiently, he always places the people at the center of what he creates. He currently works as a Design Educator at Balsamiq, a design software company, where he helps designers and product folks learn best practices of all phases of UI and digital product design. Previously, he led large UX teams at various corporations&#8217; internal design groups, such as Threadless, where he led the design and development of several mobile applications, the design of the Artist Shops program, and facilitated partnerships.</p>
              <p>Billy&#8217;s passion for making started at an early age, but it wasn&#8217;t until college that he became fascinated by all forms of design. He prides himself in bringing the creative community together and does so by hosting creative events in partnership with local design groups, as well as mentoring young designers by facilitating portfolio reviews and project critiques. He is also an Adjunct Lecturer at Northwestern University&#8217;s Segal Design Institute.</p>

              <h3>Rapid Prototyping in the Design Process</h3>
              <p>No one likes spending hours of time on a well thought out design, only to learn that the idea behind the design wasn&#8217;t backed by user feedback. Creating with a prototype mindset makes it easier to create quickly, without the added anxiety of thinking you will need to crumple it up and throw away later.</p>
              <p>Rapid prototyping is quick, often rigged workflows built for the purpose of proving or disproving an idea or assumption. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that design and rapid prototyping are two very different things. When you think design, you think pixel-perfect, time consuming layouts.</p>
              <p>We&#8217;ll work through how these two very different actions play an important part in user experience design. Learn how rethinking your approach to usability sessions as a rapid prototyper will allow you to either prove or kill an idea in record time.</p>

              <h3>8 Ways People Screw Up Their UX Portfolio</h3>
              <p>Portfolios are required for designers, researchers, strategists, and managers. Yet, most people in our field do not want to show off their work. In many respects, we do not understand the essentials of a killer portfolio until we see it. In this session, Ian Fenn will explain the essentials of your portfolio. He will give practical tips and tricks to make sure you show the best version your &#8220;self&#8221; in your portfolio. In addition, Ian will explain the importance of treating your portfolio like a product that you design.</p>

              <h3>A Digital Designer&#8217;s Carbon Footprint</h3>
              <p>Designers may be inadvertently contribute to climate change through their normal, everyday activities. As digital designers, we use a lot of resources and since many of them are digital we tend to overlook the impact we can have on our environment.</p>
              <p>We can change our behaviors, practice sustainable design, and reduce our carbon footprint by practically applying behavior change, which is definitely part of our role as designers. A lot of conversations about climate change give a very zoomed-out view where the individual level contribution is completely discarded. We&#8217;ll discuss ways to change our behaviors and have an impact on climate change as individuals.</p>

              <h3>Your System is a Language</h3>
              <p>Software development, component-oriented design, and content strategy practices all emphasize the idea of building a &#8220;shared vocabulary&#8221; to make communication between team members easier. But a vocabulary implies grammar, context, and more&hellip; What can we learn about our content models and design systems by taking the metaphor of language seriously?</p>

              <h3>Think Like a Developer to Design Better Structured Content</h3>
              <p>If you work on websites from the ground up, you know the pain of seeing your best-laid content plans go awry. Hasty help text, mysterious CMS constraints, and unclear user stories can turn even the sharpest strategy into a sad site.</p>
              <p>When you plan structured content with the mindset of a developer, you can avoid more confusing pitfalls from the get-go. Time will be saved, and you&#8217;ll ensure developers can use your work, and plan richer content, empowered with a clear understanding of what&#8217;s possible.</p>
              <p>In this session, you&#8217;ll learn:</p>
              <ul class='list-ul'>

                <li>How to write user stories that resonate with an end-to-end team</li>
                <li>How to turn content needs into a clear UI for content authors</li>

              <h3>Don&#8217;t Let Ambiguity Be the Death of Your Design Project</h3>
              <p>It seems like everything is fast-paced and we don&#8217;t always have the luxury to get all the answers we need before we start diving into our design process, which can be frustrating—if not paralyzing! Dealing with ambiguity is part of the design process, and yet it can feel overwhelming every. single. time. Even worse: the more we climb in our careers, the more it seems we&#8217;re expected to be experts at everything, and context switching between.</p>
              <p>Gathering information, or just enough information to get started, is a key element of success in the design process. We&#8217;ll explore different frameworks to help you understand and identify risk tolerance, decision-making techniques, and how to keep moving while still reaching outcomes.</p>

              <h3>Mapping the Journey of a Design Career</h3>
              <p>The User Experience field is an infinitely rewarding one that has no shortage of serendipities, fears, risks, wins and losses. My story is one of fear and bravery, bravery and fear, all told from the fresh perspective of a designer who is convinced she is just getting started.</p>
              <p>How do you design a career you&#8217;ll be proud of? How do you turn constraints into advantages? These are the questions I want to explore as I talk about my own journey into UX from traditional design. From past failures to wake up calls and personal reinventions, I&#8217;ll map out this human&#8217;s journey so far.</p>
