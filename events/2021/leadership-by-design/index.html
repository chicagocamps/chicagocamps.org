          <p>On Thursday &amp; Friday, August 12th &amp; 13th, from where ever you are. Since we&#8217;re not going to be in our space, let&#8217;s meet in yours! We&#8217;ll have 2 days of stellar keynotes and focused design leadership presentations with thoughtful Q&A that allow you to gain a lot of insightful learning. In addition,each day has an uplifting interstitial that provides a nice break.</p>
          <p>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago-including all of these wonderful speakers. We&#8217;re used to amazing views, great coffees, too many snacks, and a lot of local Chicago-area food goodness. Since we can&#8217;t do that we&#8217;re going to postpone our full sessions until 2022.</p>
          <p>And we&#8217;ve got a really cool t-shirt based upon the poem &#8220;Worthy&#8221; by Emily Haines LLoyd, author of the book <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Pep-Talk-Poetry-unmitigated-badass/dp/1073499839/" rel="nofollow">Pep Talk Poetry</a> and interstitialpresenter, which is brought to you in collaboration with our pals at <a href="https://www.nerditees.com/" rel="nofollow">Nerditees</a>:</p>

              <h3>Design for Cognitive Bias: Using Mental Shortcuts for Good Instead of Evil</h3>
              <p>Users&#8217; minds take shortcuts to get through the day. Usually they&#8217;re harmless. Even helpful. But what happens when they&#8217;re not? In this talk I&#8217;ll use real-world examples to identify some particularly harmful biases that frequently lead users to make bad decisions. I&#8217;ll then talk about some content strategy and design choices we can use in our apps, designs, and platforms to redirect or eliminate the impact of those biases. Finally, I&#8217;ll explore our own biases as designers and some methods to prevent our own blind spots from hurting users.</p>

Backed by her personal experience and evidence-based research, Temple shares her valuable insights on all types of thinkers (i.e. pattern, visual, and audio thinkers), why they are important, what jobs they are best suited for and ways in which young people can continue to think about and understand what it means to be innovative.</p>

She took a brief stint to learn how to apply her design and research skills to physical spaces by earning a certification in interior design. Energized by ambiguity and forging a path forward when there is none, organizational design, Carmen seeks to understand how people are impacted by services, technology, and policy. A strong advocate for building trust between teams, clients, and the people they serve, she is focused on ensuring our language, code, and practices are inclusive and accessible to all.</p>

              <h3>What Therapy Taught Me About Design &amp; Creating Healthy Teams</h3>
              <p>Maintaining a healthy self and extending that to our professional lives are journeys. The root cause of many of our inner and outer conflicts stem from the stories we tell ourselves. The beliefs that support those stories are deeply held and often unnamed. My therapy journey started on a cold, rainy day on a bus in Portland, OR. I knew I wanted to find peace, but what I gained was so much more. I learned to let go of beliefs that didn&#8217;t serve me personally or professionally. My goal is to share what I learned, how I reframed those beliefs in my own life, and what I learned about design in the process.</p>

              <p>Carmen is an organizational heretic and all-purpose troublemaker whose only real expertise is asking stupid questions and noticing odd, new things that might amount to something…or maybe not. Carmen spent 32 years at CIA but when you meet her you will hardly notice. The top five skills that people on LinkedIn endorse her for are government, national security, international relations, program management, and change management. But the people who think she&#8217;s a good program manager are sadly mistaken as Carmen describes herself as task-phobic. She is the co-author of the book: Rebels at Work: A Handbook for Leading Change from Within, which was informed by her career as a heretic at the CIA.</p>
              <p>She likes to speak in public and will go just about anywhere if you pay her expenses. She is an in-demand expert on critical thinking, diversity of thought, and intrapreneurship, speaking to Fortune 500 companies, major non-profits, and governments. Some of her most recent presentations include speaking at South by Southwest 2019 and TEDxMidAtlantic on Surviving as a Change Agent, at SXSW2018 on avoiding the Mediocrity Trap, and on Critical Thinking at SXSW 2017. Recently she has spoken: to US Treasury officers on Diversity of Thought; to Canadian Federal senior executives about Diversity of Thought and Rebel Thinking, to the California STEM Education conference 2020, at the Business Innovation Factory 2017, and multiple times at GovLoop&#8217;s NextGen Leadership summit.</p>
              <p>Carmen describes herself as Puerto Rican by birth and Texan by nationality. She likes to garden and cook things that she has grown. She has an extensive collection of Karaoke songs and you are always in danger of becoming the after-dinner entertainment.</p>

              <h3>Redesigning Leadership</h3>
              <p>After 45 years in the labor force, more than 30 of them in so-called leadership positions, I&#8217;ve learned that just about everything I was ever taught formally about leadership was wrong. My advice today for someone aspiring to be a leader would be quite different from what I was brainwashed to believe.</p>
              <p>I&#8217;ve got six basic principles to share, and the seventh one is no matter how convincing I may sound, be your own person and become the leader you uniquely are meant to be.</p>

              <p>What happens to your customer&#8217;s digital assets when they pass away? Do you have a way for next of kin to notify you? Policies in place for verification? Processes to handle archival and/or transfer of control? Employees who are trained on what to do and how to do it well?</p>
              <p>In this brief talk, I will explain why it&#8217;s of great importance to design this part of the customer experience well and the risks involved when you don&#8217;t, and share a 4 part framework that will help you put the right things in place to protect the business and your customers.</p>

              <p>With 30 years of experience, Meena has consulted to emphasize the strategic value and positioning of qualitative research in the design of product, space and service. Meena is fascinated by the complexity of human behavior, and applies a credible, structured and transparent approach to integrating human stories and anecdotes into mainstream processes. This ensures that research activities provide the best service to the organization, and that learning objectives are addressed to maximize potential.</p>
              <p>Meena is a founding member of <a href="http://www.twigandfish.com/" rel="nofollow">twig+fish</a>, a research and strategy practice based in Boston, MA, that espouses these research beliefs, while maintaining a utopic work-life balance. She is also a key Lecturer in the Bentley University Human Factors and Information Design (HFID) graduate program. Over her 20-year tenure, her capstone qualitative research course has guided now-leading practitioners to integrating meaningful and successful research practices.</p>
              <p>She holds an M.S. in Information Resources Management from Syracuse University and a  B.Com . in MIS from the University of Ottawa, Canada. Meena is always inspired in her work by her other passions, namely performing as a South-Indian Classical Violinist, pursuing culinary arts through a cooking show, and staying up to date with her two teenager interests!</p>

              <h3>The Cost of Not Conducting Qualitative Research in Organizations</h3>
              <p>When we fail to include the human story in the designs of our products and services, we fail humans. twig+fish has worked with global customers and we frequently hear the same challenges: no time, budget, or value to qualitative research output. Products suffer when they are not anchored in the human story, and the humans who create and use them struggle even more. Rather than talk about the ROI of conducting qualitative research, twig+fish began to study the cost of not doing it.</p>
              <p>Meena Kothandaraman shares the results of this internal study that looks at the costs to organizations who have left their decision-making to sources other than the wisdom and insights gained from qualitative research.</p>

              <h3>Systems Thinking &amp; Design Ethics for Design Leaders</h3>
              <p>Systems are tricky, slippery things, especially complex adaptive systems that bring humans and digital technologies together. In this 15 minute focus session, we&#8217;ll do a whirlwind tour of Systems Thinking and the ethical implications of a systemic paradigm on user experience and service design. Because here&#8217;s the thing about systems: once you see them, you can&#8217;t unsee them. We&#8217;ll walk through three not-so-simple proposals for how we might up our design game in a systemic world.</p>
