          <h2>UX Camp: Home Edition is a 1-day mini-conference delivering design goodness to you, where ever you may be.</h2>
          <p><strong>On Saturday, June 5, 2021 at 10AM CT, from where ever you are</strong>&mdash;we&#8217;re serving up 2 awesome keynotes that bookend up to 12 (3 tracks) really great presentations!</p>
          <p><strong>Interested in getting on a virtual stage?</strong> <a href="/proposal">Submit your talk idea!</a></p>
          <p><strong>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago</strong> for some (hopefully) nice weather, great views, city sounds, and then the abundant food and snacks that we like to provide from the comfort of Columbia College Film Row.</p>
          <p><strong>Things are different now, and we want to do something that is great for our community</strong>, spreads to the broader community, and still provides opportunity for presenters to present and attendees to learn. We&#8217;re giving this a shot, and we hope you&#8217;ll give us a shot, too!</p>

              <h3>How We Do the Work Matters</h3>
              <p>We&8217;ve told ourselves and each other for years that we should be happy with small victories&mdash;we worked with our teams to make the world a little more accessible. And yes, knowing that we made a difference is both motivating and professionally satisfying. But what happens when that isn&8217;t enough? How can we measure our work? How do we know we are getting better at practicing our craft? The answer lies in how we actually do the work, because how we do the work actually matters.</p>

              <p>Adam Polansky is not a new face in the UX Community having been a regular fixture at events and meet-ups around the world for a long time. Even if you never heard of him, you won&#8217;t have to look far for someone who does and not because he&#8217;s published a seminal book about UX (he hasn&#8217;t) or because of a continuous presence on social media but because of his network.</p>
              <p>His career has taken him from consulting for companies like the first real-time hotel booking site to Texas Instruments. He was the UX Director at Travelocity leading projects both public-facing and administrative projects. Today he is a Principal with Bottle Rocket, the first corporate app designer partnered with Apple and now setting the standard across Experience Design as part Ogilvy Experience.</p>
              <p>Along the way, he&#8217;s done some modest publishing, taught UX graduate courses at Kent State, participated in the management and organization of several conferences, and for the last 10 years, working with speakers, especially new voices, preparing them and helping them get to the microphone themselves.</p>

              <h3>The Long Game: A New Mindset for UX Networking</h3>
              <p><em>&#8220;The long game is built on relationships.&#8221; &mdash; Russell Nohelty</em></p>
              <p>There is strength in community. The careers within UX all require a degree of empathy which requires patience and care. It&#8217;s for this reason, a strong personal network doesn&#8217;t take shape overnight. It&#8217;s a long game and in 2021, there are new dynamics to consider both where you work and across the industry internationally.</p>
              <p>During this visit, you&#8217;ll learn some different ways to think about networking. NOT in terms of what you&#8217;ll get from it but instead, what you put into it Find out what deliberate presence, kindness, and generosity as a foundation for building relationships will do what you can&#8217;t by collecting connections in LinkedIn.</p>
              <p>This session won&#8217;t all be about theory or philosophy either. We&#8217;ll cover very specific do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts and insights unique to UX that will more closely align you with others in the field. Whether you&#8217;re fresh out of school, transitioning-in from a different career, or you just want to extend yourself into the broader UX community, you will take away something you can use tomorrow to build a strong and fruitful matrix of interrelated people that will endure for decades&hellip; if you look after it.</p>
              <p>The short game may earn some reward. The long game, if you play it well, is its own reward and it won&#8217;t be what you think.</p>
              <p>&hellip;it&#8217;ll be even better.</p>

              <h3>How to Make the Right Design Portfolio to Land Your Next Job</h3>
              <p>As a hiring manager at Amazon, I&#8217;ve seen a gazillion resumes and portfolios. I&8217;ve also been part of review panels for portfolio presentations from intern level to management roles. I&#8217;ve seen the patterns in what works, what doesn&#8217;t work, and what sets a candidate apart from the rest. In this talk, I&#8217;ll walk you through what you need to make a solid portfolio, no matter how much of your design work you&#8217;re allowed to show.</p>
              <p>If you&#8217;ve ever applied for a design job, you&#8217;ve probably had to make a portfolio. From all levels&mdash;entry to senior leadership&mdash;hiring managers are asking to see portfolios. What if you have nothing you&#8217;re allowed to show because of IP restrictions? What if you&#8217;re a voice designer or information architect? Or, heaven forbid, a design manager being asked to present a portfolio? Relax, I can tell you exactly what you need to do.</p>

Her favorite part about her career is the flexibility, work-life balance and ability to take on projects of her choosing in her free time.</p>
              <p>Her recent focus stems from the early days in her career when she noticed how undiverse all office settings she was hired in were amongst other challenges faced by women in man-dominated spaces&mdash;she felt like a unicorn for being there while also feeling out of place after having earned her place. Ana now seeks alliances with organizations that are assisting with this disparity in STEM within minority communities from girls as young as 10 to women with seasoned careers. When she&#8217;s not working, you can catch Ana traveling to different countries around the world, taking photographs of her surroundings, eating pizza and being active in Austin&#8217;s outdoor scenery.</p>

              <h3>How to Talk to Your Developers About Accessibility</h3>
              <p>Although generally thought of as something only important to the &#8220;disabled&#8221;, considering accessibility for digital products improves everyones experience. This is true regardless of their particular abilities. Instead of treating accessibility as a checklist or afterthought, it&#8217;s important to build it into every decision being made in a technology project. Like many requirements that are commonly thought of as something included for a niche audience, accessibility is something that not only addresses the needs of the deaf or blind, it broadens the scope of how well all users interact with your product.</p>
              <p>Accessibility is far more than just accommodating to a small audience of users with &#8220;special needs&#8221;. At its core, accessibility is about making sure that as wide an audience as possible can use the products you have worked so hard to create.</p>
              <p>Although by no means the only myths that have built up around the limitations of making digital products accessible, these seven crop up most regularly. In this session, Jason will examine each myth individually, expose why they are not true, and talk about how to dispel them.</p>
              <ol class='list-ol'>
                <li>Myth: Accessibility only helps the &#8220;disabled&#8221;</li>
                <li>Myth: Accessibility is just about the visual and auditory</li>
                <li>Myth: If we are 508 Compliant, we are accessible</li>
                <li>Myth: Accessibility compliance is a checklist</li>
                <li>Myth: Accessibility is the designer&#8217;s job</li>
                <li>Myth: Accessibility takes too much time & costs more</li>
                <li>Myth: Making a product accessible limits design possibilities</li>

              <p>A tinkerer at heart, Jess McPheron is an ideating and problem-solving enthusiast. Curiosity and a passion for creating led him into the world of product management seven years ago when building his own ecommerce concept. This period of curiosity led to a career in product management for both early stage and high-growth startups.</p>
              <p>Having worked in research to inform the development of turnkey protein products, one of which won the NuW Excellence Award, Jess established a strong foundation of leveraging industry and competitive research to form educated opinions. Since then, he&#8217;s spent time in SaaS environments, mainly focused on innovating and iterating new products.</p>
              <p>Given the background in research and product development for both consumer packaged goods and software, Jess has formed a unique perspective about how teams should operate and products should be built. He has learned the importance of combining various research and feedback inputs with a cohesive team dynamic to ship quicker while still providing value&mdash;and what happens when you don&#8217;t.</p>
              <h3>Delivering On-Going Value: Creating a Dynamic Relationship Between Product Managers &amp; Designers</h3>
              <p>Regardless if you&#8217;re building a net new product from the ground up or iterating something that is a little more established, there are two critical inputs that often get overlooked by product managers; customer feedback and establishing healthy collaboration with the design team.</p>
              <p>Neglecting these inputs can have two different areas of impact. On one hand, you are building blind based on instinct which will march the team in circles. On the other hand, you are siloing functions that are critical to success, and treating design more like a service. If you ignore the two simultaneously, you&#8217;re likely to have a fractured product team that lacks vision, and buy-in amongst the team.</p>
              <p>This talk will cover why you should talk to your customers throughout various stages of the product life cycle, what questions to ask when, why the inputs are sometimes ignored and when that&#8217;s okay. We will talk about the fluid relationship between the two inputs, who should lead what, and how prioritizing even the smallest wins can keep you marching towards your North Star. Combining these will keep the team organized, aligned, and energized, leading to a more inclusive & energized product team.</p>

              <h3>How The Evolution of Usability in Chess Can Influence User Experience Design Today</h3>
              <p>​What does an old game like chess have to do with user experience? It&#8217;s a great example of long standing user experience and design&mdash;it transcends time and languages, and moved across empires. A player in the 1600s would be able to play the same we play today. In this post-Queen&#8217;s Gambit world, chess is even more popular than ever online, in part due to the pandemic.</p>
              <p>UX continues to evolve as technology quickly develops, but there are still mental models that users expect online. Similar to chess&mdash;we all know what the pieces look like, the ways the pieces move, but how a player gets to their goal is up to an individual player. We&#8217;ll examine the history of this great game and explore the many attempts to modify and customize the game over centuries as popularity grew, but there is always a return to its original form—and what user experience designers can learn from this and apply to our work today.</p>

              <h3>Humility: The Designer&#8217;s Most Essential Trait</h3>
              <p>Humility is essential to doing our best work. Why? Effective visual communication and intuitive UX are not subjective; every objective design decision we make carries weight, and is bigger than us. We must understand the privilege, and the responsibility, that are inherent in our craft.</p>
              <p>And, in communicating. In <em>connecting</em> with people through design.</p>
              <p>When there are clear project goals to be reached and problems to be solved, having a willingness to listen, learn, understand, grow, evolve, and connect will fuel you&ndash;and your design&#8217;s&ndash;evolution.</p>
              <p>If we are always students of our craft, we are always making ourselves available to evolve. &#8220;Experience&#8221; does not equal &#8220;expert&#8221;, despite having a monogrammed portfolio or a blue checkbox next to your Twitter handle.</p>
              <p>Through the lens of vulnerability of a career&#8217;s journey inclusive of early success, and the resulting effects on his design and personal growth, join Justin Dauer as he talks through how the human connection must always lead in evolving ourselves as designers, our work, and our career&#8217;s journey. We can&#8217;t settle for anything less: you, your work, and those on the receiving end of what you create, <em>deserve</em> nothing less.</p>

              <h3>Conscious Uncoupling &mdash; Innovative Ways to Separate User Habits from User Needs</h3>
              <p>When modernizing a legacy system, it&#8217;s easy to just recreate what exists&mdash;only a little better. This is an especially dangerous trap when the users equate what they need with what they already have. But what happens when your users don&#8217;t understand why they&#8217;re doing things a certain way? When their behavior is so ingrained that they can&#8217;t differentiate the what from the why?</p>
              <p>When trying to understand current processes and uncover user needs for the new system, we encountered a wall of dogma separating our research team from the real problems users were trying to solve or the tasks they really needed to accomplish. It was nearly impossible for users to articulate why they were doing things — other than saying that was the way they had always done it. So how do you break habitual behaviors and get buy in from your users for changes that challenge their beliefs?</p>
              <p>In this talk, we&#8217;ll share our experience uncovering user needs that are buried under layers of habit and complacencies. Participants will learn how to keep asking why until you get to the root of the need by using an outcomes-first approach to help users understand the difference between what they do (and why!) and what they truly need.</p>

              <p>Currently, she is leading XAPPmedia&#8217;s patented Optimal Conversation Framework, as part of the framework, and is working on launching a self-service product for customer service.</p>
              <h3>The UX of Conversation Design</h3>
              <p>We are expecting a future with voice-integrated visual interfaces; an understanding of voice interface is therefore becoming increasingly important for UX designers. Conversational Design has high demand for good designers and the demand is increasing daily as the technology becomes better.</p>
              <p>This talk is for UX designers, new or experienced, who are interested in the voice space. I&#8217;ll first introduce conversational design, how it is applied in many facets of daily life today including cars, home assistants, on phones, talking refrigerators and so on. I&#8217;ll go over the key differences between a visual and voice interface and the corresponding differences in usability testing and validation process. Then, I&#8217;ll identify any elements that the UX and Conversational design process share including user research, user flows, user stories, strategies and prototyping and testing, and how a UX designer can bring these skills into conversational design right away.</p>
              <p>We&#8217;ll connect UX concepts to conversational design, so that you can articulate and relate your skills as an experienced UX designer. This information will help give you the background necessary to work with, for, or as a Conversational Designer if you haven&#8217;t done it before—and can also help you  when interviewing for a Conversational Design job. Resources and additional learning/courses in Conversational Design will also be shared.</p>
