              <h3>Building Character: Creating Unique, Consistent Experiences with Design Principles</h3>
              <p>Inconsistency is one of the most common points of breakdown and frustration in the interactions and experiences we have. Whether we&#8217;re interacting with other people, apps, our bank, our doctor, our government, anyone&mdash;we form expectations of what someone or something will do based on our previous experiences and their past behaviors. When something happens that doesn&#8217;t measure up to those expectations–that seems out of character–we&#8217;re caught off guard. What do we do next? What should we expect now?</p>
              <p>Conversations about consistency in design often focus on topics like content and interface design, ensuring that we use the same labels, controls, patterns throughout our creations. But what if we thought about  consistency in the relationship between users and our products or services?</p>
              <p>Principles act as rules that guide how we think and act. Formed by our motivations, values and beliefs, we use them as &#8220;lenses&#8221; through which we examine information in order to make decisions on what to do. And because of their persistent influence on our behavior, they influence other&#8217;s views and expectations of us. Using these same kinds of constructs throughout the design process we can design unique content, valuable  interactions and consistent behaviors that set and live up to expectations for our audiences.</p>

              <h3>How We Get Wicked Good</h3>
              <p>Did you ever wonder why so much of our work seems harder than it should be? Does it feel like you are constantly working at altitude, trying to do more work with less oxygen? Well, Karen&#8217;s first job in tech was in 1993. You read that right. <strong>1993.</strong> That&#8217;s almost 30 years across different roles and companies, all in technology and digital products. And no matter how much more skilled we all get, things just seem to be getting harder. How do we move from barely surviving to practically thriving?</p>
              <p>In this new talk, we&#8217;ll discuss how we get wicked good: moving through competency and mastery to sustainability, even in environments that seem to be set up for failure, disappointment, and eventual burnout. We&#8217;ll explore how to make our work spaces kinder, more inclusive, and more supportive of long term engagement and growth while at the same time encouraging us to be more thoughtful and intentional about the design decisions and career choices we make.</p>

              <h3>Making Creativity Out of Masked Air: How To Stay Relentlessly Creative Through a Pandemic And Beyond</h3>
              <p>So many of the things we used to rely on to fuel our creativity before the pandemic&mdash;meeting new people, traveling, visiting museums&mdash;have been off-limits for many of us over the past year. Staying creative can feel nearly impossible—and fear not: there&#8217;s hope.</p>
              <p>I&#8217;ve developed a framework for boosting your creativity no matter the circumstances. I&#8217;ll share how to harness your curiosity as a focal point, and how to break that down and to help identify ways to reignite your creativity. The process infused my life with renewed energy that sparked my creativity&mdash;from my sketchbook to my day job and even on to receiving a promotion!</p>

              </h2>
              <p>Cliff is a Principal Designer at Salesforce, helping build world-class customer experience tools. For him, experience design is a strategy for creating positive change in the world for others—not in a vague sense, but a literal one.</p>
              <p>Transparency, feedback, and accountability are critical components of any equitable system. Great design work treats these components as requirements for success and leverages them to better ensure human-centered outcomes.</p>
              <p>Cliff put this perspective to work through experience design, thoughtful presentations, and lots of experimentation.</p>
              <p>

              <h3>Building Confident Users in the Space Between</h3>
              <p>Siloed organizations aren&#8217;t incentivized to improve the space between products, despite the massive opportunity it presents. Seizing that opportunity is as much community organization as it is design.</p>
              <p>Enterprise customers increasingly interact with multiple products from the same company. From rapid acquisitions to market opportunities, companies are frequently introducing products and services that are ostensibly interconnected. Users can transfer knowledge of existing product mechanics and flows to new ones, resulting in faster adoption and time-to-value—but that won&#8217;t happen by accident.</p>
              <p>I&#8217;ll show how we&#8217;ve managed these efforts at Salesforce: how we built momentum internally, enlisted stakeholders, co-created, made decisions, and set ourselves up for constant improvement.</p>

Her experience is split between technical writing, advertising, and UX, and people think she&#8217;s passionate about her work because she waves arms a lot.</p>
              <p>In her spare time, she&#8217;s a terrible guitar player, half decent singer and an near professional television watcher.</p>
              <h3>Content Design for Non-content Folks</h3>
              <p>You did your research, you found the problem. You came up with great concepts and design. But you get to user testing, and all your users can talk about is the content: they don&#8217;t get it.</p>
              <p>In these days of tight budgets and lean teams, you&#8217;re expected to wear many hats. So, in the absence of a content professional, how can you tighten up that content so clients can absorb it?</p>

              <h3>Speak to Inspire: Confident Communication in the Distributed World</h3>
              <p>On-camera anxiety and Zoom fatigue can make it challenging to be and present your best self. Being a confident communicator is not just the way you act, talk, and look. It&#8217;s a habitual way of thinking and reacting to various life situations. There are steps you can take to transform your mindset and nervous system so that you can be fully expressed on camera and in your whole life (and hopefully in-person again someday).</p>
              <p>You can learn how to become an engaging and influential leader and cultivate the communication tools needed to effectively share your ideas. In this talk we'll explore how to break down the barriers, misconceptions, and fears that prevent people from being fully heard.</p>
              <p>And, you'll become aware of small changes to your words, tone, and non-verbal communication to improve how you interact in high-stakes personal and professional communications.</p>
              <p>And, you'll learn some virtual speaking basics to shine in our new virtual communication world.</p>

              <p>Kathy is the US-born daughter of Chinese-born parents. As an Asian-American, she experienced her childhood as a third culture kid. That meant always being afraid to be &#8220;too Asian,&#8221; as if she had to maintain a certain amount of &#8220;whiteness&#8221; to fit in, never mind that she was born and raised in the suburbs of Maryland. But that also meant being open-minded, and understanding that there are people from other parts of the world, because that’s where her family is from as well. That also meant finding a home in people, rather than places.</p>
              <p>As a product designer, Kathy leverages her skills to make an impact in social issues that are close to her heart (racial equity, restorative justice, and animal welfare). She graduated from Cornell University, with her bachelors degree in China and Asia Pacific Studies, and her masters in Information Science and UX Design. Kathy is currently a product designer at IBM, based in Austin, TX.</p>

              <h3>Using Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy to Design for Minorities</h3>
              <p>Have you ever found yourself at a loss for what to say in response to &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why we need to point out race&hellip; we&#8217;re all humans here?&#8221; Have you ever stood in line at the coffee shop, and overheard a heated argument, but went back and forth between wanting to stand up for the person being yelled at and thinking it was none of your business? Have you ever caught yourself in a situation where you just couldn&#8217;t tell if someone was being racist or not?</p>
              <p>If you answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to any of these questions, then you&#8217;ll understand why Allied Voices was formed. We&#8217;re a platform that enables you to navigate your racial landscape by reading other people&#8217;s stories of similar incidents, and how they handled them.</p>
              <p>Join us as we dive into how an Uber ride initially inspired the project, how we addressed the issue of coming off as tone-deaf in initially only addressing Asian-American struggles, how we took user trust into consideration (as we made design decisions on the way we displayed different types of content), and what surprising takeaways we found through rigorous user testing.</p>
              <p>You&#8217;ll walk away with a new understanding of how to use your design skills for social impact, and how to approach, and even embrace, uncomfortable conversations as a designer.</p>

              <h3>Designing Through Imposter Syndrome: Using a Goal-based Framework to Navigate Career Growth in Design</h3>
              <p>The design industry doesn&#8217;t make it easy for any of us to be designers—and it can seem even more challenging to be a great designer. We all want to do great work; however, great design is subjective! We all want to grow our skills, and our industry is riddled with tool debates, in-fighting about who is a designer, who should code, and any number of other competing viewpoints that make it difficult to know if you&#8217;re on the right path.</p>
              <p>Design, the noun, verb, and industry, can leave even the strongest of us doubting ourselves and wondering what we need to do next. I&#8217;ve struggled with imposter syndrome, and through the reflection of my own experiences transitioning from development to design, I&#8217;ll share the framework that is helping me find my growth path so you can tailor it to meet your needs, and target the future that makes the most sense for you.</p>
