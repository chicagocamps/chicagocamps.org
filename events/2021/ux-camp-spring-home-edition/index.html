              <h3>Building Character: Creating Unique, Consistent Experiences with Design Principles</h3>
              <p>Inconsistency is one of the most common points of breakdown and frustration in the interactions and experiences we have. Whether we&#8217;re interacting with other people, apps, our bank, our doctor, our government, anyone&mdash;we form expectations of what someone or something will do based on our previous experiences and their past behaviors. When something happens that doesn&#8217;t measure up to those expectations–that seems out of character–we&#8217;re caught off guard. What do we do next? What should we expect now?</p>
              <p>Conversations about consistency in design often focus on topics like content and interface design, ensuring that we use the same labels, controls, patterns throughout our creations. But what if we thought about  consistency in the relationship between users and our products or services?</p>
              <p>Principles act as rules that guide how we think and act. Formed by our motivations, values and beliefs, we use them as &#8220;lenses&#8221; through which we examine information in order to make decisions on what to do. And because of their persistent influence on our behavior, they influence other&#8217;s views and expectations of us. Using these same kinds of constructs throughout the design process we can design unique content, valuable  interactions and consistent behaviors that set and live up to expectations for our audiences.</p>

              <h3>Making Creativity Out of Masked Air: How To Stay Relentlessly Creative Through a Pandemic And Beyond</h3>
              <p>So many of the things we used to rely on to fuel our creativity before the pandemic&mdash;meeting new people, traveling, visiting museums&mdash;have been off-limits for many of us over the past year. Staying creative can feel nearly impossible—and fear not: there&#8217;s hope.</p>
              <p>I&#8217;ve developed a framework for boosting your creativity no matter the circumstances. I&#8217;ll share how to harness your curiosity as a focal point, and how to break that down and to help identify ways to reignite your creativity. The process infused my life with renewed energy that sparked my creativity&mdash;from my sketchbook to my day job and even on to receiving a promotion!</p>

              </h2>
              <p>Kathy is the US-born daughter of Chinese-born parents. As an Asian-American, she experienced her childhood as a third culture kid. That meant always being afraid to be &#8220;too Asian,&#8221; as if she had to maintain a certain amount of &#8220;whiteness&#8221; to fit in, never mind that she was born and raised in the suburbs of Maryland. But that also meant being open-minded, and understanding that there are people from other parts of the world, because that’s where her family is from as well. That also meant finding a home in people, rather than places.</p>
              <p>As a product designer, Kathy leverages her skills to make an impact in social issues that are close to her heart (racial equity, restorative justice, and animal welfare). She graduated from Cornell University, with her bachelors degree in China and Asia Pacific Studies, and her masters in Information Science and UX Design. Kathy is currently a product designer at IBM, based in Austin, TX.</p>

              <h3>Using Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy to Design for Minorities</h3>
              <p>Have you ever found yourself at a loss for what to say in response to &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why we need to point out race&hellip; we&#8217;re all humans here?&#8221; Have you ever stood in line at the coffee shop, and overheard a heated argument, but went back and forth between wanting to stand up for the person being yelled at and thinking it was none of your business? Have you ever caught yourself in a situation where you just couldn&#8217;t tell if someone was being racist or not?</p>
              <p>If you answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to any of these questions, then you&#8217;ll understand why Allied Voices was formed. We&#8217;re a platform that enables you to navigate your racial landscape by reading other people&#8217;s stories of similar incidents, and how they handled them.</p>
              <p>Join us as we dive into how an Uber ride initially inspired the project, how we addressed the issue of coming off as tone-deaf in initially only addressing Asian-American struggles, how we took user trust into consideration (as we made design decisions on the way we displayed different types of content), and what surprising takeaways we found through rigorous user testing.</p>
              <p>You&#8217;ll walk away with a new understanding of how to use your design skills for social impact, and how to approach, and even embrace, uncomfortable conversations as a designer.</p>
