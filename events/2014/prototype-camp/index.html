              <h3>Goodbye Specs, Hello Prototypes</h3>
              <iframe class='podcast-player event-podcast-player' seamless src='https://simplecast.fm/e/4054?style=light'></iframe>
              <p>As a developer, architect and now Product Manager, I&#8217;ve spent most of my career trying to turn software ideas into reality. For many years, I worked on teams that adhered to the Way of the Functional Spec, an ancient practice whereby a product leader spends countless hours producing a document that uses text to describe the future state of software, only to see that document become useless by the time the first line of code is written.</p>
              <p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve experimented with all of the agile and Product Management techniques designed to help drive down uncertainty in software and foster clear, high-fidelity collaboration between product leaders, designers and engineers. Some have been useful, others not.</p>
              <p>About two years ago, a few product teams at my current company began toying with the idea of replacing our existing spec work with prototyping. Instead of working with text-based docs, a PM would work with an Interaction Design to create an interactive piece of software that conveys the vision for a product or feature.</p>
              <p>This was one of the best decisions we ever made. High-fidelity prototyping is now a critical component of our product workflow, and we&#8217;ve become addicted to using these assets for collaborating with customers and internal teams alike.</p>
              <p>In this session, I&#8217;ll will share how one software company abandoned functional specs and PRDs for the green pastures of prototyping. Using a case study format, I&#8217;ll share challenges we overcame, victories we experienced and tips for embedding a full-on Prototyping workflow in any software organization.</p>

              <p>The fundamental process we follow of how we understand design problems, users, and content hasn&#8217;t changed much, but the documentation we deliver is a bit in flux. We&#8217;re experts in the field of solving problems with design in a digital world. However, device fragmentation forces us to think through flexible experiences with portable content and in turn, to rethink how we communicate to our clients throughout the process.</p>
              <p>In this session, you will learn proven documentation, or better yet communication techniques using simple HTML and PHP to get us to a living breathing prototype, earlier in the process. All the while helping us as communicate flexible design decisions to both clients and team members.</p>

              <h3>Garbage In, Garbage Out: Optimizing Design Inputs for Successful Prototypes</h3>
              <iframe class='podcast-player event-podcast-player' seamless src='https://simplecast.fm/e/4311?style=light'></iframe>
              <p>We&#8217;ve all heard the phrase &#8220;Garbage in, Garbage out&#8221;. The quality of a product or service is often linked to the quality of the underlying components. When it comes to prototypes, the truth is that much of the important work happens before we ever create a prototype artifact. This may include brainstorm sessions, creating requirements documents, analyzing an existing system, etc. More often than not, the effectiveness of the prototype is linked to how effectively these different aspects are managed in the pre-design process. Whether you are a designer, business representative, project manager or developer, this session will provide you with effective techniques for managing design inputs to create better prototypes.</p>

              <p>Once that prototype leaves the safe confines of your office it could encounter slow network connections, devices that won&#8217;t behave as expected, and corporate firewalls that are ready to shut you down. So you&#8217;ll have to be prepared to improvise on the fly, but will be ready with the real world examples covered in this look at prototyping for the road. Strap yourself in, it&#8217;s going to be a fun and enlightening ride.</p>
              <p>Because after you&#8217;ve created that perfect prototype, covered all the anticipated use cases, fixed all the bugs so that it works as it&#8217;s expected to, and considered all of the web browsers and mobile devices you have to deal with&#8211;you&#8217;re still not done!

              <p>The City X Project is an international edtech curriculum that uses 3D printing and the design process to turn kids into Changemakers tackling world problems. It is the largest program of IDEAco, a Chicago-based nonprofit building learning experiences that fuse design thinking and technology around the world.</p>
              <p>Accessed by more than 500 teachers across 50+ countries since its release in April 2014, the City X Project is a globally-tested open education resource that was developed through 15 months of rapid-fire prototyping and testing&#8211;all said, 17 iterations in five countries across three continents and four languages. Not only was the City X Project itself prototyped, but kids in the workshop also learn about the value of failing, iterating, and prototype their ideas as they use the design process to create hypothetical inventions that can tackle challenges we face as a society.</p>
              <p>I will share our experience prototyping the workshop around the world (from the mountains of Lebanon to the tundra of remote Alaska), tell the story of a special kid whose City X prototyping will soon be literally &#8220;out of this world&#8221;, and share some of the best kid-designed prototypes that might just one day change our future.</p>

              <h3>The Tail of a Wireless Dog Collar: Building a Hardware Product with a Globally Dispersed Team</h3>
              <iframe class='podcast-player event-podcast-player' seamless src='https://simplecast.fm/e/4320?style=light'></iframe>
              <p>This is the tale of a globally distributed team of individuals who came together to build a product for their dogs in 2013 without ever having been in the same room together. Month by month, the team started to grow and now includes individuals from the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Venezuela and Pakistan, all working to bring the product to life and into the marketplace of wearable dog collars.</p>
              <p>A few of the experiences to be shared with the audience will include how team member initiatives and responsibilities have been divvied up, approaches to making routine team communication work and insights into assembling iterative hardware and mobile software prototypes. Additionally, we&#8217;ll share some of our progress that was presented recently at the Boomtown Accelerator&#8217;s Demo Day in Boulder, Colorado.</p>

              <iframe class='podcast-player event-podcast-player' seamless src='https://simplecast.fm/e/4078?style=light'></iframe>
              <p>Four years ago I left the world of design agencies behind and joined an early stage, fast growing Startup as the first UX Designer. For me, the shift in paradigm from client to product work has been equal parts humbling and enlightening. As our product has evolved and the team has grown, the ability to iterate quickly has been at the heart of our success. From scrappy, low fidelity animated gifs to production ready features, I will explore the world of prototyping at <a href="http://sproutsocial.com/" rel="nofollow">Sprout Social</a>.</p>

              <iframe class='podcast-player event-podcast-player' seamless src='https://simplecast.fm/e/4017?style=light'></iframe>
              <p>From contextual inquiry, to un-moderated remote usability testing, to in-lab participatory design sessions you have many methodologies and stages of prototypes at your disposal. Learn how to use prototyping effectively to aid research and to form a comprehensive research strategy for your projects.</p>
              <p>Just like the evolution of a design, your research strategy needs to evolve as you move from concept to end-result. This talk explores a case study showing where the research strategy involved multiple techniques and stages of prototyping new features for Android and iPhone apps.</p>

              <iframe class='podcast-player event-podcast-player' seamless src='https://simplecast.fm/e/4379?style=light'></iframe>
              <p>Usability testing can be very demanding. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that!&#8221; Especially in the fast paced development world we work in. We need to adapt our methods to learn how users respond to our prototypes without the design or team taking a hit.</p>
              <p>Lessons from the field have taught me that testing prototypes requires us to take a fresh look at usability testing. Learn how to remain flexible while testing your prototype to ensure you get the most out of your time and the team by pruning your process, being ready to change on the fly and prepping reports without losing sleep.</p>
              <p>Before you know it, your project team will be hooked and asking you to schedule more tests.</p>
