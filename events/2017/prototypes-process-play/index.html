              <h3>Design is a Team Sport</h3>
              <p>Every seasoned designer has fallen into the trap. They see the bad design in front of them. They can&#8217;t help but see how bad it is. And they want to redesign it. Show the world how it could be done. How it should be done.</p>
              <p>Well-intentioned as the desire to rid the world of this bad design is, their approach often is a disaster. It pushes their allies away, accidentally giving off the air of superiority filled with the smells of arrogance and contempt.</p>
              <p>An alternative is a well-designed process for creating your designs. The secret sauce in that well-designed process is a realization and inclusiveness of everyone on the team. It&#8217;s infused with an understanding of how people contribute to the design process, even when they aren&#8217;t trained in design skills. And it opens up opportunities to give everyone—not just your trained designers—the superpowers necessary to rid your products and services of bad design.</p>
              <p>This talk will inspire you and your team to:</p>
              <ul class='list-ul'>
                <li>Realize the reason everyone thinks they are a designer is they are a designer, however unskilled</li>
                <li>Learn that our design processes need to be designed, with intention and thoughtfulness</li>
                <li>Focus on helping every contributing influencer of your designs become a consciously competent designer themselves</li>

              <h3>Broad Influence &#8211; How Women are Changing the Way America Works</h3>
              <p>Executive office has proven the hardest glass ceiling to break. Less than 5% of Fortune 1000 CEOs are women, just 18% of America&#8217;s mayors, 12% of governors and, of course, zero presidents. There&#8217;s a huge body of research that shows, whether it&#8217;s a legislature, a corporate board, a Navy ship, or an appellate court, when women reach between 20-30% of the leadership at any given organization it&#8217;s a tipping point and they begin to change how things are done &#8211; for the better. Jay shows where we&#8217;re reaching that tipping point &#8211; all three branches of the government &#8211; and the areas where we not &#8211; such as Silicon Valley and Wall Street, and why it&#8217;s important for us to get to critical mass across the board.</p>

              <p>Carmen, a retired Senior Federal Executive with 32 years&#8217; experience in the Intelligence Community, is a recognized national and international expert on intelligence analysis, strategic thinking, diversity of thought, and innovation and intrapreneurs in the public sector. She is the co-author of the new book: Rebels At Work: A Handbook for Leading Change from Within and of the landmark Deloitte University Press paper on Diversity&#8217;s New Fronter: Diversity of Thought and the Future of the Workplace. Her story as a heretic and change agent at CIA is featured in Wharton School professor Adam Grant&#8217;s new bestseller Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World.</p>
              <p>From 2005-2007 Carmen was part of the executive team that led the CIA&#8217;s Analysis Directorate; in her last assignment before retiring she oversaw the CIA&#8217;s Lessons Learned program and led the Agency&#8217;s first effort to address the challenges posed by social networks, digital ubiquity, and the emerging culture of collaboration. She was a leader on diversity issues at the CIA, serving on equity boards at all organizational levels and across Directorates. She was the first CIA executive to conceptualize many IT applications now used by analysts, including online production, collaborative tools, and Intellipedia, a project she personally green-lighted; as a senior executive, she began using in 2005 social networking and blogs to reach her diverse workforce. Upon her retirement from CIA, she received the Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal. From 2011—2015, Carmen was a member of Deloitte Federal Consulting where she served as senior advisor and mentor to Deloitte&#8217;s flagship innovation program, GovLab.</p>

              <h3>Lead Above Mediocre Thinking</h3>
              <p>When we engage in design thinking for our teams and projects, it&#8217;s easy to emphasize Design over the Thinking. Leaders know that we need to slow down to speed up; plan and think more to prevent rework and waste. Sometimes, we invest more in the work and the artifacts over finding the right ways to work together and create a shared understanding before moving toward a goal. Carmen Medina spent her entire career working with a diverse set of people and she had to find ways to create a shared space for collaboration&#8211;and she&#8217;ll show you how to focus on HOW teams work over WHAT the work is that&#8217;s being done.</p>
              <p>All of this, regardless of whether or not you have a security clearance!</p>

              <h3>Curiosity, Skepticism, Humility: Achieving the Right Mindset for Design Discovery in Teams</h3>
              <p>Discovery, the first part of the design process, is crucial for aligning teams and leading them to design success. A well-aligned team works toward the same goal, and brings out the best in each other because they all understand what their trying to achieve.</p>
              <p>Discovery can take many forms: a multi-month endeavor to prepare for a complex business application, or a four-day &#8220;sprint&#8221; to align the team around a vision for a new product. Whatever the form, however, teams are prepping and priming themselves to do detailed design and development work.</p>
              <p>Discovery is complicated, chaotic, and messy. In discovery, teams gather information about the problem and then explore different ways to tackle it. Through critical thinking, they refine their understanding of the problem and zero-in on a concrete plan for execution. Discovery requires participants to shift attitudes and perspectives almost constantly. Team members go from &#8220;tell me more about&#8221; to &#8220;how about this idea&#8221; in the blink of an eye.</p>
              <p>To pull this off successfully, team members need to embrace a discovery mindset. This attitude emphasizes learning. It relies on team members maintaining an open mind, questioning everything, and above all not taking themselves too seriously.</p>
              <p>In this session, we&#8217;ll look at why this attitude is important, how it affects your team&#8217;s approach to discovery, and ways you can cultivate this mindset in yourself and those you lead.</p>

              <p>Getting others to listen to you is hard. Whether those people are your team members, peers across your organization, the c-suite, or a board up above, you need to inspire them and move them to action to be most effective at your job.</p>
              <p>Storytelling is one of the most powerful ways you can get people to listen to you and to move them to action. But in a business context, the stories that you tell are only as effective as the stories that you build&#8230; and get others to build with you. We&#8217;ll look at how story drives some of the most successful product and service&#8211;driven organizations out there. Learn how story sparks systemic design thinking, collaboration, and innovation that enables you to more effectively build successful products and services that people get excited to work on&#8230; and use.</p>

              <h3>Designing for Diversity in Organization Design</h3>
              <p>The lack of diversity in design organizations is a fact that we can design for. We can drive innovation and increase creativity, but we have to be honest about what&#8217;s holding us back. Eli Silva will outline ways to design cultures that support design thinking, organizational growth, and diversity in the workplace.</p>
              <p>Great design is the result of hard work and cultures that foster empathy, creativity, listening, and honest conversations. These happen to be the groundwork for diversity, so why is diversity still such a challenge in technology and in design organizations in particular?</p>
              <p>In this talk you will learn practical steps toward designing for diversity—including quick tips on how to audit your processes and practices today. Learn how to effectively consider minorities and underrepresented groups in your approach to hiring, everyday work, and leadership development. The result of diverse design organizations is products that increasingly reflect actual people, across the age, gender, and income spectrum. That&#8217;s something worth working for.</p>

              <h3>Governing with Intention</h3>
              <p>Our digital future is upon us, and we already need more mature approaches toward governing digital channels. We need to be clear about the roles and responsibilities of those who conceive of&#8211;and deliver&#8211;that which is being consumed online. We also need to be intentional about what is being built; and our design teams will need to be organized to meet the goals of our users. Lisa will focus on the decision-making aspect of digital governance and how organizations and groups can better organize teams to work efficiently, ethically, and creatively.</p>
              <p>The first 20 years of digital have focused on growth, technology building, and finding new ways to exploit the capacity of digital. Hopefully, the next 20 will be the beginning of a maturity process where individuals, organizations, and governments will not only continue the expansion of digital, but also thinking more comprehensively about the impact of what is built and delivered.</p>

              <h3>Making Moonshots</h3>
              <p>A critical part of leadership is the reduction of ambiguity for your team. Your job is to make it clear, so the team can work towards the goals you&#8217;ve set. The reality is that many of the goals you&#8217;re setting are make-or-break for the future of your organization. If you work in a field like design or innovation, you&#8217;re probably already sick of hearing the word &#8220;moonshot.&#8221; Maybe you&#8217;ve even been part of one, or more likely, you&#8217;ve unwittingly part of many. As a leader, moonshots are part of the job.</p>
              <p>There&#8217;s just one problem with the &#8220;moonshot&#8221; approach: the real moonshot wasn&#8217;t a single giant leap forward. It was a series of incremental experiments designed to test the riskiest parts of going to the moon, as soon as possible. This approach put humans on the moon within a decade of Kennedy&#8217;s famous speech, and it&#8217;s the same approach that the best innovators like Elon Musk use to get rapid traction on the hardest and most complex problems of our times.</p>
              <p>This session will demystify complex, challenging &#8220;moonshot&#8221; initiatives and give you a set of principles and practices that you can use to wrestle the riskiest innovation challenges to the ground. You&#8217;ve already got the tools: research, prototyping, planning and production. Now, let&#8217;s help you to connect them together with the right questions and perspectives, getting the traction you need make innovation work practical and successful.</p>

              <p>What happens when you&#8217;re asked to step-up and lead the work of the design team or to manage your fellow designers for the first time? Most of us envision ourselves sketching ideas, designing solutions, or prototyping our days away, forever in our happy place. And we&#8217;re no different&#8211;we had no idea what to expect, beyond knowing what we saw that we thought was good or&#8230; not so good.

              <h3>Getting a Seat at the Table and Keeping It!</h3>
              <p>Design is now finding it has a seat at the leadership table, but is it/are you viewed as a practitioner of an arcane science that is called upon to facilitate business processes? Or, are you also routinely called upon to contribute to the overall business strategy at the company&#8211;wide or departmental level? Building strong, domain capability will maintain your status as a design expert, but it won&#8217;t lead to your being trusted as someone who can help build the overall business strategy. That requires a complementary set of skills.</p>
              <p>Talk to any CEO in organizations small and large and she will tell you about the critical role technology—and design&#8211;play in that business&#8217; success. Ask that same CEO to describe how the design functions contribute to the day-to-day operation and it&#8217;s likely she will describe an enabling or support role.

              <h3>Usability Testing &amp; Development on a Shoestring Budget</h3>
              <p>As an indie game studio, we had a shoestring budget for developing Mushroom 11, an award winning video game on desktop and mobile. This talk will explain how we used prototyping to make fast iterations on our design and how we used trade shows and other marketing events as ways to collect user data which informed our design process throughout development.</p>

              <h3>How to Design a Company</h3>
              <p>Back in 2001, I quit a perfectly good job and founded a UX consulting firm in a garage (a clich&eacute;, I know, but it&#8217;s true). Sixteen years later, Centralis is a thriving research and design firm with a small but mighty staff of UXers dedicated to both our craft and the company. Along the way we&#8217;ve learned that designing a company isn&#8217;t so different from designing a product. In this talk, I&#8217;ll share some of the lessons we&#8217;ve learned through prototyping, gathering feedback, and iterating on our organization.</p>
