              <h3>Presenting Design Work to Decision Makers</h3>
              <p>The job of design includes collaborating with decision makers to accomplish business goals. Successful designers create shared understanding of complex ideas, in addition to doing high quality design work. Unfortunately, explaining the design rationale yields low levels of success. More effective communication strategies use a broader spectrum of tactics to start collaboration, get buy-in, and share knowledge.</p>
              <p>Gail will explain how to create a presentation strategy, identify purposeful details, and handle difficult moments. Be more successful by learning to use work presentations as an opportunity to connect and make progress.</p>

              <h3>The Map Is Not The Territory: Collaborative Content Modeling for Digital Teams</h3>
              <p>The rise of content strategy has given digital teams a new way to tackle the challenges of publishing and product design. Concepts like a shared &#8220;content model&#8221; promise better communication and coordination… but somehow, most teams still manage to talk past each other.</p>
              <p>Developers, designers, content editors, and stakeholders all care about different aspects of the content—and use different tools to capture their pieces of the puzzle. The good news is that these different views don&#8217;t have to conflict. By using each discipline&#8217;s perspectives to inform the others, we can gain a clearer and richer understanding of the content-avoiding common pitfalls, developing better lines of communication, and spotting often-overlooked opportunities for improvement.</p>

              <p>Brad Nunnally is the Senior Director of User Experience at Intellibridge and a co-author of &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321886720/" rel="nofollow">Designing The Conversation: Techniques for Successful Facilitation</a>&#8221; for New Riders (Voices That Matter) and &#8220;<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048336.do" rel="nofollow">UX Research: Practical Techniques for Designing Better Products</a>&#8221; for O&#8217;Reilly Media. During his career, Brad has worked with clients spanning almost every major industry, mostly focusing on healthcare, financial services, and government digital services.</p>
              <p>Brad has enjoyed writing and speaking on topics that include user research, interactive prototyping, and how cognitive psychology applies to design. These days, he contemplates how the government can be redesigned to be more person centric and how organizations can build and mature design teams to meet the demands of how business and technology work today. When he is not thinking about the world of design, he spends time learning important life lessons from his children, playing too many video and tabletop games, and learning woodworking through a constant string of failures.</p>
              <h3>See What I Mean &#8212; The Hidden Language of the Body</h3>
              <p>As designers, we are lucky enough to get to interact with many different types of people during the course of our work. We observe people using technology and proposed design solutions. While working on our projects, we collaborate directly with our team, clients, and stakeholders to bring a solution to life. All of this interaction exposes us to lots of body language. The language of the body offers up many hints and insights into what people are thinking and feeling. It&#8217;s been said that our bodies communicates what is really on our minds, and it&#8217;s important to know not only what others might be telling you but what you could be telling them.</p>
              <p>It&#8217;s important for designers to have a fundamental understanding of body language and patterns they should look for when interacting with users or team members. There are key patterns that, when observed correctly, can tell you if someone is supportive of your idea, hiding their true feelings, or simply sitting back and daydreaming the meeting away.</p>
              <p>Observing non-verbal communication cues is only one side of the coin though, the other side being your own body language. Inherently knowing the patterns and signs of the body opens your eyes to the messages you might be giving off. The ability to manage your own body language is something that can be learned and mastered, helping you become a better collaborator and communicator.</p>
              <p>Participants will walk away from this session with a basic knowledge of how to read and respond to common non-verbal communication patterns and learn how to better manage their own non-verbal communication. They will be armed with additional resources to continue on their path of mastering the language of the body.</p>

              <h3>The Journey to a Better Bar Graph</h3>
              <p>How do you take something like a basic bar graph and make it beautiful without making it overly complex, or worse, misleading? Thinking about well-designed data visualization often conjures images of complex charts whose beauty lies in the dense texture of the data they bring to life. However, these visualizations are often lacking when it comes to being easily read and consumed by another human being.</p>
              <p>In this talk, I&#8217;ll discuss how to meet in the middle by visualizing information in an intuitive, but also beautiful way. We&#8217;ll walk through a brief history of data visualization and look at various types of graphs and charts as well as ways of getting visualizations &#8220;past default.&#8221; Attendees will walk away with a better understanding of why graphs are the way they are, the parts you can keep and the parts you can change, and a framework that can be used right away to create more compelling visualizations in their everyday work.</p>

              <h3>UX Field Research Basics</h3>
              <p>With the speed at which technology is changing, field research offers understanding into how products can impact the lives of your customers. Regardless if it&#8217;s your first or hundredth time, conducting field research is a daunting task. Planning and conducting field research is a juggling act between preparation, interview skills, and synthesis. In this talk, I&#8217;ll share some of the key principles involved in any researcher&#8217;s toolkit and explore lessons learned from the three main stages of conducting field studies:</p>
              <p>Stage 1: Planning and prep &#8212; Gathering good research data starts with proper planning. This includes everything from writing interview questions and developing an interview guide to recruiting participants and determining logistics.</p>
              <p>Stage 2: Out in the field &#8212; Research can drain you both physically and mentally. David introduce some tricks to keep your mind sharp, allowing you to give each session your focus.</p>
              <p>Stage 3: Finding the patterns &#8212; The data resulting from field research grows quickly. David outline a few techniques for making the most out of limited time and managing mountains of information.</p>

              <p>We&#8217;ve all had that moment where it becomes apparent that various designers created the UI for your product. It also becomes glaring that reusable parts of the UI have divergent thinking contributing to inconsistencies in experience. There is a trend enterprise organizations are embracing to address these common problems, Design Systems.</p>
              <p>Companies such as Salesforce and Google have embraced the notion with systems like Lighting and Material. At Paylocity, we&#8217;ve been fortunate to have found success creating the Citrus Design System alongside a company that grew to be a top twenty tech company that tripled its revenue. We&#8217;ll share some of our most critical findings; failures, challenges and defining moments over the last two years that helped shape our shift to a design mindset as an organization.</p>

              <h3>The Benefits of Iterative Failure</h3>
              <p>As design thinkers, we must focus on the process and not just the end goal. This presentation will address the benefits of creating environments that allow teams to take risks and fail; through this failure, they become more resilient, more realistic, and more accountable. In turn, their future work is more thoughtful and they have a greater ability to be nimble, collaborate, and pivot away from ineffective ideas.</p>

              <p>Lauren is a UX content strategist, writer, and editor based in Chicago. She&#8217;s currently a UX Content Strategist at Capital One, where she uses words to design product experiences that feel like meaningful, personal conversations with customers.</p>
              <p>Lauren loves to talk about things like honest UX, content-first UX design, and how to build meaningful relationships in the workplace and in the larger UX community. Most recently, she&#8217;s spoken at WebVisions Berlin and at the Women in Design and Tech Leadership Forum in Berlin and London.</p>
              <p>She is also a bookworm and a fierce lover of all things pizza. Her long term life goals involve lots of travel to faraway places, hopefully with a good book within reach.</p>

              <h3>Real Talk: Designing Content That Builds Trust</h3>
              <p>As content strategy continues to grow, it&#8217;s adapting to the needs of different organizations. While it used to be synonymous with writing web content, copywriting, and content marketing, that&#8217;s no longer the case. Now, we content strategists design messages to create meaningful, personal interactions with customers across across app interfaces, error messages, transactional communications, and more. Essentially, we are experience designers. It&#8217;s just that instead of visual elements, our main tool is words.</p>
              <p>With this increased influence comes responsibility. As designers and content strategists, we need to constantly be thoughtful about how we&#8217;re positioning messaging in our experiences. We need to build trust with our customers, and much like trust between people, the only way we can do this effectively is by being upfront, authentic, and honest in our communication at all times. When we&#8217;re not, we end up failing our customers in a big way.</p>
              <p>Lauren will talk about her experience as a content strategist on design and product teams at Capital One, and will showcase some of her go-to content strategy techniques and tools. She&#8217;ll introduce some questions and frameworks that can be iteratively applied throughout our design processes to maintain the integrity of our content.</p>

              </h2>
              <p>Currently I am working in Cox Automotive&#8217;s Enterprise Operations Center helping them with the redesign of their IT Scorecard website. My role is varied depending on the what the project needs. I&#8217;ve been doing more work in Interaction Design and Information Architecture but in the past I have done UI development as well prototyping (HTML, CSS and Javascript) that is eventually ported over to whatever the client&#8217;s end system is utilizing.
              <p>In 1999 I discovered Improv while living in Chicago, starting classes at Second City. Improv taught me how to be more aware of the moment, how to listen more instead of just responding and that a group working together in a non-judgmental and supportive manner can create much greater things than any of those individuals could on their own.</p>

              <h3>ImprovUX: Creating a Culture with Trust, Empathy &amp; Collaboration</h3>
              <p>With more Agile and Lean processes becoming commonplace, people are working in larger and more diverse teams. The teams can be comprised of UX professionals, subject matter experts, marketing professionals, technical experts, business stakeholders etc. How do you bring these people from varied silos together quickly so they can effectively solve problems together?</p>
              <p><em>Answer: Improvisation</em></p>
              <p>Improvisation and its basic tenets stress listening, agreement and non-judgment. Those tenets help foster an environment of trust, empathy and connection which all support better collaboration between people (as well as creativity, less fear of risk etc.). ImprovUX is action (you&#8217;ll be walking the walk!) as everyone will be participating in Improv exercises that focus on these skills. The audience gets to experience how it feels when you let yourself be present and open in a supportive and fun environment.</p>

              <p>Nikola has been obsessed with technology since he was about five years old and his father brought home a computer from work. He quickly learned how to break it&#8230; and then, in turn, fix it (else he couldn&#8217;t play his games). He discovered that he experienced great joy in helping others figure out how to work their computers which ultimately led him to pursuing a career in the UX field.</p>
              <p>Nikola&#8217;s been excited about touch-less, gesture, voice, and gaze-based interfaces since he first encountered them in science fiction. During his Master&#8217;s at DePaul HCI his capstone focused on the topic, over seven years ago. He backed the Oculus Rift on Kickstarter five years ago (in 2012) and has been anxiously anticipating the days when computing no longer consists of tapping and swiping on glass rectangles.</p>

              <p>According to non-profit organization Color Blind Awareness, 8% of men and 0.5% of women in the world suffer from color blindness. It is crucial to develop websites that are accessible to color-blind users. I will first go over the accessibility guidelines on color and contrast from W3C as well as a series of dos and don&#8217;ts examples. I will then dive into a set of new non-color-based animations and transitions. These can be used to provide interaction feedback (active state, select state, etc) using SVG and D3.js. The attendees will walk away with useful tools and principles to build accessible UI for color-blind users.</p>

              <h3>Facilitating Google Design Sprints</h3>
              <p>Making products that customers love is hard. So giving yourself 1 week to do it sounds crazy.</p>
              <p>But many companies spend months or years building products only to learn that their customers don&#8217;t want it. Google&#8217;s Design Sprint solves this problem by focusing a cross-disciplinary team on a clearly defined problem, empowering them to generate many creative ideas, and ensuring they are building the right product by putting a prototype in front of customers in just 5 days.</p>
              <p>This highly collaborative process breaks down silos and brings cross-functional project teams together to ensure all product perspectives are represented. But facilitating the room for a full week can be difficult. You&#8217;ll need to manage different personalities, encourage divergent thinking, build agreement, teach new skills and keep everyone moving on schedule.</p>
              <p>Zeke will teach you techniques he&#8217;s learned by effectively facilitating Google Design Sprints for clients at Table XI.</p>
