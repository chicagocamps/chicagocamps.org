                </div>
              </h2>
              <p>As a renown Design Leader and agency CEO, Andy helps companies like Virgin Holidays, John Lewis and Penguin Random House with issues of customer experience, product strategy, and digital transformation.</p>
              <p>Andy&#8217;s role at Clearleft is to set strategy and vision, promote the value of design, and help our clients realise their digital potential. Andy is very active in the day-to-day running of the company, managing our leadership team, setting company culture, and looking after the happiness and wellbeing of our 30+ staff.</p>
              <p>Andy is a designer at heart, having spent over 20 years in the field. He loves using his knowledge of design, technology, and human behaviour to influence product strategy. As such, Andy is in his element when working alongside board members and their management teams.</p>
              <p>In his early career Andy helped pioneer the field of Web Standards through his work, his blog (one of the highest trafficked in the UK at the time), and the publication of his best selling book &ndash; CSS Mastery. Later, Andy helped popularise the field of UX design, setting up the UKs first dedicated UX agency, along with it&#8217;s first and arguably best UX conference.</p>
              <p>When he&#8217;s not running the company or managing our creative output, Andy can be found sharing his wealth of knowledge at conferences around the world like SXSW, An Event Apart and The Next Web. He also curates the UX London and Leading Design conferences. In 2011, Andy co-founded the Brighton Digital Festival, a citywide celebration of digital culture attracting 40,000 visitors and over 190 events. These are just some of the reasons his company has won Netmag Agency of the Year on several occasions, and he&#8217;s appeared on both the Wired 100 and BIMA 100 lists.</p>
              <p>Never happier than when he&#8217;s diving some remote tropical atoll, Andy is a qualified PADI dive instructor and retired shark wrangler.</p>

              <h3>The Accidental Design Leader</h3>
              <p>Andy first came to prominence in our industry as a designer and web standards enthusiast. He was driven by a desire to improve and professionalise the industry, which is how he came to start the UKs first user experience consultancy, Clearleft. He never set out to be a design leader, but now find himself leading a team of thirty people, almost by accident.</p>
              <p>In a quest to understand what makes a great leader, and help his friends in newly minted leadership positions, Andy started the Leading Design conference and Slack community. Over the past 18 months, Andy has interviewed dozens of prominent leaders and listened in on hundreds of Slack conversations about the art and craft of leadership.</p>
              <p>In this session, Andy recounts his journey into leadership, shares his successes and failures, and the important lessons he&#8217;s learned on the way. The result is a talk packed full of design leadership heuristics suitable for leaders of all shapes, sizes, levels and seniorities.</p>

              </h2>
              <p>Antionette D. Carroll is the Founder and CEO of Creative Reaction Lab, a nonprofit social enterprise designing healthy and racially equitable communities for Black and Latinx populations. Creative Reaction Lab is creating a collaborative youth-led, community-centered movement challenging racial inequities in the education, media, health and healthcare, and government and public service sectors. Throughout her career, Antionette has worked for non-profits working for social justice, human rights, and diversity and inclusion. Antionette&#8217;s personal mission in life is to CHALLENGE standards, make CHANGE, and CHAMPION approaches resulting in foundational and community impact. As a former Ferguson resident, the death of Michael Brown, Jr. changed her from a typical 9-to-5 graphic designer to a social entrepreneur, design thinking facilitator, community organizer, and social impact design advocate.</p>
              <p>Also, Antionette is an active community volunteer. Antionette was named the Founding Chair of the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force of AIGA: The Professional Association of Design in 2014. Currently, she&#8217;s the Chair Emerita of the Task Force working on long-term strategic initiatives such as the Design Census Program with Google and national Inclusivity in Design Summit. With her encouragement, AIGA created the first Racial Justice by Design program, with Antionette co-organizing and assuming the role of online producer for the national Town Hall in 2016.  At the local level, she is currently serving as the President Emerita of AIGA St. Louis and co-founder of the Design + Diversity Conference. Antionette also sits on several awards and programming committees for local and national non-profits. Antionette is a TED Fellow.</p>
              <p>Antionette credits growing up in economic poverty, but having supportive community wealth as catalysts that guide her journey as a lifelong social changemaker.</p>

              <h3>Context/Leader Fit</h3>
              <p>Any seasoned designer or PM knows the importance of context: users, goals, environments, and business needs all shape the &#8220;best&#8221; solution to a given problem. And yet, designers and leaders frequently assume that a process, skill set, or attitude that worked in one place is the one right answer. Kim will discuss:</p>
              <ul class='list-ul'>
                <li>What characteristics of organizations demand different things from leaders</li>
                <li>How to assess your leadership effectiveness within a given context</li>

              <p>Not everyone wants or needs a warm, supportive manager, and not everyone wants or needs the tough, task-focused boss. I&#8217;ve come to realize that my usual style of mentoring and motivating people on my teams does not work for everyone, much to my dismay.  There are many shades of leadership in between, and knowing what each team member needs means discovering the answers to deeper questions about what makes them who they are.</p>
              <p>You&#8217;ll need to uncover what inspires and motivates each individual team member, while also understanding how they&#8217;ll respond to ambiguity or sudden change. You&#8217;ll also need to do this while handling your day job and while also keeping them&ndash;and yourself&ndash;from burning out. We&#8217;ll discuss some approaches to tackling most of this (that burn out one&hellip;) and share tips on empathy and emotional resonance that can help you build stronger and more genuine ties to your team in order to set them all up for their best success.</p>

              <h3>Where Is My Mind? &ndash; Risking Security &amp; Finding Sanity by Leaving Big Business for Small Design</h3>
              <p>Have you ever wondered if you could be the boss? Not just the manager, or the design leader, but someone who is ultimately responsible for decisions that shape the success or failure of your company? I&#8217;m going to tell you about my journey to become the boss, and share the lessons I&#8217;ve learned about accepting risk, finding value, creating worth, and seeing benefit in the design field.</p>
              <p>Something tells me that this is the type of thing that gets easier the second time, but, to me, there were no do-overs in this adventure. It involved going all-in and gambling without a safety net. Along the way, I&#8217;ve found myself pondering a second mortgage to keep the lights on, losing employees and clients at the worst times, riding project highs followed by periods of drought, and somehow constantly running out of bourbon.</p>
              <p>And this was exactly what I had been looking for. Maybe it&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for too, so I&#8217;ve got some stories for you.</p>

              <h3>DESIGN BOSS: Leading UX in the Enterprise</h3>
              <p>Leading design in a large organization is more than just &#8220;doing design with more people.&#8221; Anyone who tells you otherwise has yet to spend their time untangling a myriad of non-design-related issues so that design work can get done. Huge teams, competing priorities, personal agendas, and outdated methodologies can make innovation seem impossible, and can discourage even the most optimistic practitioners.</p>
              <p>Some planning, some data, and a whole lot of patience will help you develop strong relationships with your product, marketing, and technology partners, create advocates across the organization, and communicate the value your team brings to the organization. If only that were all there is to the job!</p>
              <p>Yes, design leader, it&#8217;s entirely possible to inspire teams, drive change, and create meaningful digital experiences in an enterprise environment. It&#8217;s not always easy, and there&#8217;s no single path to success&ndash;let&#8217;s start with what I&#8217;ve learned to point you in the right direction.</p>

              <p>Despite widespread praise for experimentation and play, &#8220;mess&#8221; still remains an insult in business books and home design blogs alike.

              <p>Health and wellness of an organization&#8217;s or project&#8217;s performance can be relatively simple. In a snapshot we can know a lot&ndash;dashboards and metrics tell us lots about how well our work is progressing, what mile stones we&#8217;re reaching, and what color-coded alert state of panic we should be in. And we can optimize our way into just about any green-colored diagram we choose.</p>
              <p>Teams, and the humans that comprise them, are fascinatingly complex and complicated. In a snapshot, we can fool ourselves into believing all kinds of things about them. And yet, we can&#8217;t really know for sure unless we dive in deeper and learn about their health, their needs, and try to help them optimize for their individual successes. In this presentation, Kara shares her approach to the care and feeding of humans, sharing lessons gleaned from working at the highest echelons of sports, entertainment, government, and technology.</p>

              <h3>Coach, Diplomat, Advocate, Architect: The Complete Design Leader</h3>
              <p>A challenge many designers face as they embrace leadership is learning how to let go of the work. All through their career, their success has been measured by their ability to deliver. Now they have to figure out how to shift their efforts to support the delivery of their teams. This may lead to an existential crisis &ndash; &#8220;If I&#8217;m not doing the work, how am I contributing value?&#8221;</p>
              <p>In this talk, Peter will outline the four archetypes of the Complete Design Leader. This leader grows their design team, provides clear expectations, and does everything they can to ensure the team&#8217;s effectiveness. These leaders must broaden their purview beyond creative matters, into the managerial and operational activities that will enable their team to succeed.</p>

              <h3>Designing the Team Experience: Building Culture Through Onboarding</h3>
              <p>Why do some project teams work well, while others just can&#8217;t seem to get it together? Why do some teams have a strong sense of culture while others feel like a group of strangers working on the same task?</p>
              <p>When a team comes together, whether it&#8217;s for a short-term project or ongoing long-term operations, a culture emerges: you can see it in how the team works toward common goals and how they interact with one another. Although you can&#8217;t force team culture, you can design for it. Through an enterprise project case study, we&#8217;ll look at onboarding techniques and methods that can be used to deliberately build strong team cultures.</p>

              <p>Have you ever wondered how an artist makes a living&ndash;not just the ones with galleries, the other ones that you see when you go to conventions, or peruse Etsy for unique items to add to your collection of whatever-it-is-you-collect? Have you ever thought about taking a passion project and making it less about passion and more real?</p>
              <p>This is what I do! I create art, using chalk (yes, that chalk), and you&#8217;ll see me creating it live at any number of fan conventions, and then I turn it into something you&#8217;d be proud to frame and hang on your wall! It&#8217;s a lot of fun&ndash;and a lot of work&ndash;to make this type of thing work. For some it&#8217;s a hobby, for some it&#8217;s a full time job. For me, it&#8217;s taking an idea and turning it into art, and finding ways to make art make money.</p>

              <p>Making podcasts isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart and I&#8217;m here to tell you why—we&#8217;ll take a shallow-dive into the craft of audio storytelling via podcasting, and the production that goes into it. Podcasts are hot—people aren&#8217;t leaving the house before making sure they have their phone, keys, wallet, and earbuds connected with their favorite show queued-up. I&#8217;m going to tell you how that all happens!</p>

              <h3>Moving You &mdash; The Work That Goes Into DJing</h3>
              <p>Music is magical&ndash;it can make us move, it can move us, it can make us forget everything for a moment, and it can make us remember things we thought we&#8217;d forgotten forever. There&#8217;s even more magic that happens when a DJ gets in the zone and makes you experience all of that for a long period of time.</p>
              <p>How does it happen That thing where you were singing and dancing along to something familiar one moment and the next you&#8217;re experiencing something completely different—yet similar—and you&#8217;re not sure when it happened.</p>
              <p>I do that, and I can promise you, it&#8217;s all by design. It takes a deep knowledge of and appreciation for music, a passion for helping others experience something great for them and created by you, and it takes precision timing and skill to keep everything going. We&#8217;ll hear and see some live DJ action, and then I&#8217;ll slow it all down and we&#8217;ll deconstruct it so you can learn all that happens when the music beat goes on and the DJs appear to be switching to glide.</p>
