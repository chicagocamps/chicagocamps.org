              <p>Natalie D Hanson is a Principal and partner at ZS, where she built and now leads the User Experience team. Prior to ZS, she worked at SAP, where she also built a User Experience team supporting Board-level projects. Natalie holds an M.A. in Whole Systems Design from Antioch University Seattle, and a Ph.D. in Anthropology from Temple University. For most of her career, Natalie has found herself surrounded by individuals and teams with deep expertise in unfamiliar domains (such as computer science, and more recently data science). As a result, she is very curious about and committed to making interdisciplinary teams work. Natalie is the founder of anthrodesign, a vibrant, global, online community of over three thousand multi-disciplinary researchers who use ethnographic methods in the business setting.

              <h3>Neurodiversity at Work: Valuing Teammates Who are Wired Differently</h3>
              <p>I am a Visual Designer in corporate America; I am also on the Autism Spectrum. I&#8217;ve thrived in my career using self-awareness as a tool for bringing out my best work and approaching design from a different direction. Growing a neurodiverse design team has its hurdles, but the pros far outweigh the cons. I will talk about improving work environments, identifying communication styles, and being a great team mate to those that are wired a bit different.</p>

              <h3>Creating User-Centered Organizations Through Rapid Usability Testing</h3>
              <p>Few will argue the benefits of usability testing, but regardless if you are a seasoned UX professional or new to the field, traditional usability testing can be extremely time consuming. Often times many will completely skip testing because the friction is so high. In my talk, I will share the lessons I learned from when I introduced a low-friction and light-weight testing framework to my colleagues at Fastly, a company that powers over 10% of all internet traffic. This new approach increased our usability testing frequency by 4x in 8 months, gave teams greater insights into their products, and gained greater adoption of the testing process throughout the organization.</p>

              <h3>What Content Strategy Can Teach UX</h3>
              <p>In my talk, I&#8217;ll discuss the role of content strategy in a project and how usability, no matter how researched and executed, stands and falls on the shoulders of content. This includes what user experience designers need to know to perform content strategy functions &ndash; even if the project doesn&#8217;t have the budget to hire a dedicated content strategist.</p>
              <p>I&#8217;ll describe how content strategy contributes to a project, including a structure for creating a project goal and plan, from message architecture through editorial calendar to style guidelines. I&#8217;ll give examples of how content strategy can help accomplish business goals without leaving the users behind and help you think about how content will be sourced, managed and measured.</p>
              <p>I&#8217;ll also give cautionary examples of what happens when you don&#8217;t include content strategy in your planning and when you put content last, instead of first.</p>
              <p>Finally, I&#8217;ll talk about how UX and content strategy folks can help enhance the other&#8217;s work and collaborate for better results.</p>

              <p>Emotional intelligence is a core competency that we should all explore to foster stronger bonds as a community.

Being more aware of ourselves through emotional intelligence, we can shape our perceptions and become a more mindful participant in the design process.</p>

              <h3>Designing Against Domestic Violence</h3>
              <p>The reality of domestic violence doesn&#8217;t disappear when people leave enter the digital world. Abusers use technology to exploit and control their victims, meaning that technologists have a responsibility to ensure that users of our products are empowered to protect their safety. How can we prevent people with violent intentions from forms of abuse and control that are digital, such as browsing a victim&#8217;s computer, finding sensitive information about them online, or creating fake content in their name? How can our products that involve real people, such as software for building managers, protect against an abuser talking their way past a building&#8217;s doorman whose uses software to track approved guests? While there&#8217;s no simple answer and ultimately no way to ensure our users&#8217; safety in all situations, thoughtful considerations and small changes while designing and building products can and does result in meaningful contributions to people&#8217;s safety. This talk will explore how to think through a lens of safety, create those thoughtful considerations, and advocate for an emphasis on safety.</p>

              <h3>The Intersection of Psychology &amp; UX Design</h3>
              <p>The human brain is so complex that understanding it has proven to be arguably the greatest challenge of modern science. It exhibits patterns that are integral to how we perceive and process information, which we&#8217;ve evolved for survival over thousands of years.</p>
              <p>An understanding of these patterns is fundamental to designing human-centered experiences, and we can use established principles from psychology to guide us. Instead of forcing users to conform to the design of a product or experience, we can use this knowledge to design for how people actually are.</p>
