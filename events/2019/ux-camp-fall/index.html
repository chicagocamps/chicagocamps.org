              <h3>Elevating User Experience in the Organization</h3>
              <p>In the early 1900s the CMO position was created, and ever since it has been one of the most heavily resourced departments in almost every major organization. The Chief Marketing Officer &#8220;controls the brand.&#8221; But over the past decade the tectonic plates of business have shifted. Earthquake after earthquake has shaped a new world in which Users sit at the Brand control panels. And broad online conversations prevented companies from using flashy marketing to cover up product problems.</p>
              <p>With all this User power, why do leading business schools still teach that &#8220;Marketing drives the business&#8221; when we all know it is the User? And why do so many organizations still struggle to &#8220;control&#8221; their brand without investing in the User up-front?  In this talk, Alex digs into the &#8220;why&#8220; AND what you can do to help shift the balance towards the User in your organization.</p>

              <h3>Taking the (Em)Path to Human-Centered Design</h3>
              <p>In UX design, empathy is a critical skill to creating user satisfaction. No one tells us how to develop empathy! Finding that connection starts with drawing from personal resources.</p>
              <p>Many people in UX careers started in positions not even remotely connected to UX design—and that&#8217;s been their benefit. These non-traditional, if not all, experiences provide unique insight when it comes to improving our empathetic approach to human-centered design. Diversity is also key to collaborating with and understanding unique voices and problem solving to meet the needs of others not like us. Along with consumer data and journeys, empathy helps design teams deeply analyze user situations to create solutions.</p>

              <p>Establishing a cohesive UX strategy is a challenge when your organization lacks a measurement framework. We&#8217;re constantly striving to make great products, but it&#8217;s difficult to get stakeholder buy-in and make product decisions when you can&#8217;t state the impact on the user experience.</p>
              <p>We understand &ndash; this happens to us too! During this session, we&#8217;ll share how we addressed this gap by exploring the framework we used for measuring UX impact across different audiences. We&#8217;ll discuss how we approached gathering usability and customer satisfaction metrics, establishing benchmarks, and applying this data to improve products. Not only will you learn about tools to help you make informed decisions on your products, but you&#8217;ll also come away with the ability to demonstrate the value of UX to your stakeholders.</p>

              <p>Most mainstream games are so good at interaction design that the complexity of these interactions is almost invisible. But when you start stripping away the elements that make them sing, it becomes obvious that something is wrong.

              <h3>Delivering a Stand-Out User Experience: UX Ethnography &amp; a (not-so) Quick Trip to the Post Office</h3>
              <p>Join me on a package delivery gone wrong and get a better sense on why User Experience needs ethnography and why technology needs UX.</p>
              <p>As humans we live in a world where daily actions and decisions are closely linked to technology. We are presented with an array of technological options for completing a simple task and the choices we make can either enhance or inhibit our experience completing those basic tasks. Opportunities for businesses to consider human-centered design are everywhere, and often the most relatable and frustrating experiences with technology are missed opportunities to consider context of use, social norms, and human culture. With technology becoming increasingly automated, ethnography provides a unique opportunity to understand how tech augments an experience rather than replaces the user&#8217;s role.</p>
              <p>From the narrative perspective of a cultural anthropologist and UX researcher, this presentation will cover how UX approaches ethnography differently, and how its focus on interaction and design marks a departure from other qualitative ethnography. From startups to tech giants, every business can benefit from understanding their customers in their real use environment, as well as all the nuance that context brings in developing and designing a product or service.</p>
