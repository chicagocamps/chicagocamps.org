              <p>Over 20 years in UX have left Karen a tiny bit unhinged, kind of sweary, and intensely committed to designing better ways for teams to work together. After years working in enterprise software, for some reason she decided that work wasn&#8217;t challenging enough and is now tackling UX in the government sector. Taking the best from human-centered design methodology and combining it with an almost unhealthy level of affection for complex, messy, human problems, she helps teams identify roadblocks and barriers to their potential, and helps them become more productive, more innovative, more collaborative, and most importantly, more human with each other. She can be easily won over with red wine, dark chocolate, or 80&#8217;s alternative music.</p>
