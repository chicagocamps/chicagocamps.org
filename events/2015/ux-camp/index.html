              </h2>
              <p>Anna is passionate (in, ahem, a professional way) about two industries: Play and Health. As Director of Product Development at Marbles: The Brain Store&#8217;s Workshop, she is fortunate to marry her most favorite pursuits by creating fun products that build better brains.</p>
              <p>Before Marbles, Anna ping-ponged between Health and Play, amassing a multitude of media skills in the process. First, she was an editor and reporter covering the Neuroscience news beat for a newswire. Next, she worked for a comic book publisher producing toys and packaging. That little department grew into an independent company called Kunoichi. During her 5 years as leadership at Kunoichi, Anna touched pretty much every toy brand under the sun. She produced animation, virtual worlds, web sites, mobiles &#8212; and more. Eventually, Kunoichi was so successful, it was acquired by Manifest Digital. At Manifest, Anna helped healthcare clients like Amgen, Humana and Cardinal Health to be more successful through play.</p>

              <h3>Designing Learning That Sticks: Collaborating with Users to Redefine the Engagement Problem</h3>
              <p>Why is it that despite innumerable teens and young adults expressing deep interest in exploring coding and app building, most still struggle to pick it up from the innumerable online and offline learning options available? By collaborating closely with our users from prototyping to now, we discovered that we needed to redefine the users&#8217; problem from &#8220;learning to code&#8221; to &#8220;building immediately useful things with code&#8221;. Additionally, we also learned that users must be able to build from their smartphones and develop a measurable sense of mastery over the concepts. As a result, Grokker.io enables users with no coding background to build immediately useful things with code while learning</p>
              <p>This talk will be about how we created and refined this continuous collaborative design process with our core user community of Chicago area high schoolers, across multiple high schools, with a tiny startup team. We will address the challenges of creating and maintaining this design culture as well as the payoffs, including massively reducing product and market risks. We will also look at how our laser focus on the user&#8217;s ultimate goals allowed us to create resonant and delightful experiences for our users, while also delivering excellent skills acquisition outcomes.</p>

              <h3>Maximizing UX Research: In-house vs. Consulting</h3>
              <p>UX research provides robust qualitative insight firmly rooted in actual user behavior, but is frequently left out of the user-centered design process. Consequently, products and services often don&#8217;t meet user expectations, and this results in frustration, decreased utilization, and sometimes total abandonment.</p>
              <p>In order to be successful, stakeholders in the development process must understand how to best utilize UX researchers. We will describe how UX researchers engage with projects in two different business contexts: as in-house staff, and as outside consultants. For UX researchers, this is your chance to see what it&#8217;s like on the other side. For everyone else, this presentation will explain how to efficiently harness user research to produce designs that are more successful the first time around.</p>

              <p>As Marshall Goldsmith cautions in the title of his best-selling book, What Got You Here Won&#8217;t Get You There. The brittle and tenuous cooperation between product management and user experience teams that often exists today won&#8217;t be enough to support the nimble production paradigm required to create the digital products of tomorrow. With the evolving role Design in the product and user experience functions and the organization at large, reconsidering the PM &#8212; UX partnership is perhaps more important than ever.</p>
              <p>Drawing on their respective backgrounds—including experience as colleagues—Dimple Rao and Ryan Wynia will offer forward-thinking perspective on the relationship between PM and UX. They will argue the PM &#8212; UX relationship is a collaboration that&#8217;s truly significant and is capable of enhancing or inhibiting the contributions of the other to the benefit or detriment of the product and organization.</p>

              <h3>Personalities, Politics, Art &amp; Design: The UX Remix of the Guggenheim Museum</h3>
              <p>The history of the Guggenheim Museum reads more like a modern user experience case study than you might expect. While it&#8217;s earned its place as a celebrated work of architecture and a revered art institution, the story of how it got there is filled with relatable tales right out of the experience design playbook. Within this story, you&#8217;ll recognize the hallmarks of any scrappy start-up from launch to success. Along the way, we&#8217;ll uncover and discuss principles of user centered design, the importance of strategic pivots, how constraints create problems and opportunities, and managing change in organizational politics.</p>
              <p>The Guggenheim Museum story takes many fascinating twists and turns from it&#8217;s humble origins as a small, focused collection in a New York City apartment to it&#8217;s current iteration as a diverse global art institution that oversees one of the preeminent modern art collections of the world. In this talk we will look at decisions, characters, problems and evolution points in the museum&#8217;s history that have parallels to, and contain lessons for, the practice of modern day user experience.</p>

              <h3>Heuristics 101: Understanding &amp; Applying Design Principles</h3>
              <p>Design heuristics are a powerful tool for UXers to have in their toolkit. These principles provide a way to ground your designs as well as communicate the &#8220;why&#8221; behind your decisions to peers and stakeholders. In addition, while technology is always changing, these principles remain the same and can easily be extended to new technologies.</p>
              <p>In this session, you will learn about common sets of heuristics you can draw on in your work. In addition, you will learn how to tailor these principles for use in emerging technologies such as social media and mobile applications.</p>

              <h3>Experience Innovation &#8212; The New Design Imperative</h3>
              <p>Experience innovation is becoming the most important element in smart companies product lifecycle. They are starting to use experience innovation to remain relevant and retain customer loyalty. Companies like Uber, Delta Airlines, Disney and Nike, to name a few, are figuring out ways to create signature moments that delight users and create significant opportunities for growth. They have learned how to look beyond their products to and see the broader experience their customers have when using their products and services.</p>
              <p>I have come up with a list of 6 ways UXers can do to get our clients or our companies we work for to start innovating experiences. I will share with you examples of how others have done it and how I have led a UX team in a giant engineering organization like Johnson Controls to innovate and impact our business directly. Ultimately we need to start doing this for the companies we work for or for our clients. Experience innovation is not a new idea and it only a matter of time before your company&#8217;s or client&#8217;s competition figures it out.</p>

              <p>Natalie Kurz is a multi-hat-wearing creature (apparently one with many heads) that helps shepherd projects from inception through the design phase, acting as a strategist, information architect and interaction designer. But at her core she is a content fanatic, having spent the last 15 years in the content biz. She&#8217;s crafted content strategies for Canon, Marshfield Clinic, Jiffy Steamer, CenturyLink and Express-Scripts. She&#8217;s currently working on content and UX projects as a Technology &amp; Innovation Fellow for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau-and working for the government has been a lot more interesting than she originally thought it would be.</p>
              <p>She has a masters in journalism from NYU, a love of good science fiction novels and a phobia of blueberries. And she&#8217;s a staunch believer that poor usability is never compensated for by good design, simplicity takes work, and the client is always right except when they aren&#8217;t.</p>

              <h3>The Unwitting Content Strategist</h3>
              <p>Few of us are formally trained as content strategists. We&#8217;re journalists. Information architects. Copywriters. Interaction designers. Digital marketers. Some are multi-headed hydras that get to wear all the hats.</p>
              <p>But that doesn&#8217;t prevent us from tackling the nebulous task of creating content strategies. So what does that even mean? What goes into creating an actual content strategy that you can sit down and execute? And how can we bring our unique perspectives from other disciples to this field to produce a better outcome?</p>
              <p>The first time I had to write a content strategy, I had to figure it out as I went. This talk will offer attendees concrete pointers, outlines, definitions and deliverables associated with that big, scary concept of &#8220;content strategy.&#8221; Attend this session and you don&#8217;t have to feel that same sense of dread I did when asked to &#8220;figure it out.&#8221;</p>

              <p>As the architectural complexities and user expectations of websites continue to evolve, viewing them as the communities that they are&#8211;or can become&#8211;is increasingly important to both their sustainability and success. How do we as technologists design, build, and maintain these properties; while also evolving the tools we use to support them?</p>
              <p>We&#8217;ll look at:</p>
              <ul class='list-ul'>
                <li>Design patterns, development processes and feedback cycles</li>
                <li>How Threadless has worked to foster collaboration between users and developers by encouraging both active and passive participation</li>
                <li>How to best leverage a community&#8217;s shared assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating digital spaces that promote users&#8217; sense of inclusion and satisfaction</li>
                <li>Looking at existing real world design patterns (e.g. universal iconography and visual wayfinding) as a means of creating more accessible user experiences in a digital space</li>
                <li>Responsible development: pushing design and technology forward without dragging users behind you</li>
