              <h3>All of Us Are Smarter Than Some of Us: How to Harness Your Team&#8217;s Collective Intelligence</h3>
              <p>Until relatively recently, innovation was considered the domain of a select few &#8220;gifted&#8221; thinkers who sit alone in their garage or some other mountaintop developing their insights in isolation. In fact, the very idea of a group of people coming together to create something game-changing was thought to result more often in mediocre outcomes due to the drag of &#8220;group think.&#8221;</p>
              <p>No longer. And the good news is that everyone possesses the capacity for break through thinking and results that truly matter. Innovation is the lifeblood of all things and occurs when people add tangible value or benefit to others through the conversion and implementation of new ideas.</p>
              <p>We have entered the age of collective wisdom; an era where it is recognized that paradigm shifting innovation requires cooperation within an ecosystem of diverse talents and creative styles. Dr. Steve Julius, a clinical psychologist and entrepreneur, will explain and demonstrate how to marshal and lead our natural desire to engage, contribute and act collaboratively in ways that allow for perceiving new possibilities and status quo changing actions.</p>

              <h3>So You&#8217;ve Got A Seat At the Table. Now What?</h3>
              <p>In recent years we&#8217;ve seen an emergence of design-led and design driven companies. Breathless articles in technology blogs herald the rise of design as the new competitive differentiator while titles like Chief Experience Officer and Chief Design Officer are becoming more common across companies big and small. In light of these trends, it&#8217;s generally accepted that design finally has a seat at the table.</p>
              <p>But getting to the table is just the beginning &#8212; what happens next brings with it an entirely new and different set of challenges. Drawing from both my own experience as well as others, we&#8217;ll take a look at what the world looks like once you&#8217;re at the table, the types of challenges you&#8217;ll come across, and some practical methods for handling them.</p>

              <h3>Design What Really Matters</h3>
              <p>Designers love to delight customers with look and feel. But if a product doesn&#8217;t solve a real problem, customers won&#8217;t care how pretty it is. For design to be effective in a business, it needs to move beyond surface-level work and contribute to the very core of how products are developed.</p>
              <p>This is a pragmatic talk about how designers can work differently to have a stronger role in product development. We&#8217;ll see how slowing down can help you move faster. We&#8217;ll look at ugly design that leads to great products. And we&#8217;ll learn how a careful design process can help companies take big leaps safely.</p>

              <p>Enable your organization to embrace and profit from the benefits of a design-led work culture.</p>
              <p>Culture change is often perceived as long and slow&#8212;but that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t approaches familiar to designers of all experience levels that can be the catalyst for evolving your current workplace culture into one that invites exploration, collaboration, and accountability.</p>

              <p>Learn how to write concise, communicable vision statements that set the organization&#8217;s sights high, how to share research with executives who may not fully understand it, and the methods to scale design&#8217;s influence across different teams and into the C-suite.</p>

              <h3>Design Organization du Jour: The Best&#8211;and Worst&#8211;of Your Favorite Design Org Structures!</h3>
              <p>Companies reorganize all the time, and when that happens it&#8217;s easy to feel scared, threatened, or even like it&#8217;s time for you to move on to more stable pastures. Fear not! Embrace your inner designer / honey badger and stop worrying about who will sit where and how teams may line up. There is no organizational structure that can break your spirit or marginalize your skill when you learn from my hard-earned lessons in the field!</p>
              <p>As empaths for users and observers of patterns, many designers are bound to notice to the rhythms of reorganization at the companies where they work. Companies may swing between centralization and decentralization in a reactive cycle, often throwing in new and/or removing processes along the way. Teams can be left confused and concerned about their futures. Gossip goes through the roof. Morale plummets.</p>
              <p>I&#8217;m here to tell you that it&#8217;s not your fault that the org chart got crazy. Learn from my experience of going through approximately 27 gazillion re-orgs—along with current research on design organizations, to show you the signs of a coming re-org, how to navigate them and lead your team through them in order to insure that the craft of design is not marginalized during the reign of any particular org chart.</p>
              <p>And don&#8217;t worry, it will all change in a year or two anyway. Luckily you&#8217;ll be ready.</p>

              <p>Deciding what to schlep on the dinner table can be a piece of cake—or a nightmare for a chef like me. I&#8217;m not one to plan ahead; I tend to cook based upon my mood, which can be based upon what&#8217;s going on around me the weather, what I&#8217;ve been influenced by on TV or in my life at any point in time, which means that where I decide to get my ingredients from changes quite frequently, as well!</p>
              <p>Designing a menu for a client isn&#8217;t clearly an art of a formula, either—sure, &#8220;lactose-free&#8221; and &#8220;gluten intolerant&#8221; requests need to be taken into consideration. However, helping people understand what the foundational core ingredients of cooking are through well-planned cooking classes, can help people understand how to figure out what to cook based upon their moods, and their influences, and whatever else is going on in their worlds.</p>
              <p>You won&#8217;t truly be a &#8220;Foodie&#8221; unless you&#8217;ve stood at your kitchen sink&#8217;s morning aftermath, closed your eyes, and while the hot water revives the gelatinous demi-glace blessed pans your soul speaks to your taste buds and says, &#8220;thank you, that was amazing!&#8221; The basics of cooking, like the basics of any other type of design, will lead you down your path to being great.</p>

              <h3>5 Tips for Designers from a Terrible Designer</h3>
              <p>I&#8217;ve been in the position to lead designers toward best-in-class, top-notch design for some of the most well-known brands in the world. Funny thing about that: I&#8217;m not a designer! I am, however a writer who knows how to unearth a creative solution, and who knows who to help others solve problems for themselves.</p>
              <p>I&#8217;ve come up with 5 problem-solving tips for designers that will help them think through and create designs more effectively and guide them to ridiculous fame and fortune, all from a person who is smart enough to know when to hire someone far better than me to do this kind of stuff.</p>

              <h3>How to be a Designer CEO at a Startup without Being a Jerk</h3>
              <p>As designers we&#8217;re told to practice empathy, learning our users&#8217; habits, unspoken needs, and desires. We use that knowledge to inform the design of a product intended to delight people. As CEOs, the skills we celebrate are different. Ford, Jobs, Elon Musk and more were known as ego-driven steamrollers who pushed people to the brink all the time.</p>
              <p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned from my time at Public Good about running a business, owning product, and empowering our team to do great work. All without being an a-hole. Most of the time.</p>

              <h3>Cartoon Creativity: What I Learned from Chuck Jones</h3>
              <p>Lessons sometimes come from unlikely sources, which is why one of modern history&#8217;s richest sources of inspiration for creativity, leadership and culture-building often goes overlooked: the mid-twentieth-century animator Chuck Jones, otherwise known as one of the fathers of Bugs Bunny and a myriad of other Warner Brothers cartoon characters. The environment he worked in grew out of an unique mix of talent, philosophy and pragmatism that all industries and artists alike can learn from. Plus: cartoons. So who wouldn&#8217;t want to learn how to work like he did? Let&#8217;s find out how.</p>
