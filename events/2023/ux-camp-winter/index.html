          <h2>UX Camp: Home Edition is a 1-day mini-conference delivering design goodness to you, where ever you may be.</h2>
          <p><strong>On Saturday, January 28, 202 at 10AM CT, from where ever you are</strong>&mdash;we&#8217;re serving up 2 awesome keynotes that bookend up to 12 (3 tracks) really great presentations!</p>
          <p><strong>Interested in getting on a virtual stage?</strong> <a href="/proposal">Submit your talk idea!</a></p>
          <p><strong>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago</strong> for some (hopefully) nice weather, great views, city sounds, and then the abundant food and snacks that we like to provide from the comfort of Columbia College Film Row.</p>
          <p><strong>Things are different now, and we want to do something that is great for our community</strong>, spreads to the broader community, and still provides opportunity for presenters to present and attendees to learn. We&#8217;re giving this a shot, and we hope you&#8217;ll give us a shot, too!</p>

              <h3>Practical Design Strategy: Creating a Human Centered Roadmap for Ambulatory Surgical Centers</h3>
              <p>Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) are a rapidly growing segment of the US healthcare ecosystem, enabling providers to perform same-day outpatient procedures in a safe and cost-effective environment outside the hospital setting. In 2018, ~5700 ASCs performed 23 million outpatient procedures and generated $35 billion in revenue. However, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are clunky and ill-suited to the needs of these centers, causing many ASCs to turn to paper charts scanned into the EHR.</p>
              <p>In 2021, a Product Lead and UX Lead were tasked to define a purpose-built ASC solution that enabled our clients to document surgical cases within the ASC, seamlessly sharing information between the patient’s surgical chart and their clinic chart. Through collaborative site visits, service blueprinting, and interviews, we:</p>
              <ul class='list-ul'>
                <li>Arrived at a clear human-centered vision and roadmap for the product</li>
                <li>Coordinated across functions to align on strategy, scope, and resourcing</li>
                <li>Prioritized and validated a list of near- and longer-term requirements</li>
                <li>Built and socialized an investment case for resources</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In this presentation, we will share the process we went through to arrive at a successful, human-centered product vision and roadmap. We will also share lessons learned, such as:</p>
              <ul class='list-ul'>
                <li>How do you build and maintain effective, impactful partnerships between UX and Product while crafting strategy?</li>
                <li>How do you convey findings that engage an audience that ranges from C-level executives to sales professionals to scrum teams?</li>
                <li>How do you maintain a human-centered lens while discussing product tradeoffs and prioritizing investment?</li>
                <li>How do you stay in touch with the higher-level strategy while empowering the teams who have to take on the work to own the problem space?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Expect to leave the presentation with a few new tricks up your sleeve, some interesting lessons on stakeholder management, and a bit more information about surgery coordination than you thought you’d ever need.</p>

              <h3>Battling Deceptive Design: The Force is with You!</h3>
              <p>Deceptive design patterns are real and can create short term engagement and profits, but they also result in long-term pain for users and online experiences. This can leave users feeling tricked or cheated and can have a lasting impact for a brand.</p>
              <p>UX Designers have the ability to influence a user through good design, or manipulate them through deceptive patterns, similar to how the Jedi and Sith have to decide how they&#2817;re using the Force. We&#2817;ll discuss the top ten most deceptive design patterns and the negative impacts they have, as well as smart alternatives that can be used to benefit users, build trust, and make for better experiences.</p>
