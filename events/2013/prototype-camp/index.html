              <p>Fred Beecher has been working in User Experience for 15 years. In that time he&#8217;s seen UX mature from a field struggling to prove its value to one driving an explosion of innovation and economic growth. To help feed the ever-increasing demand this explosion has sparked, Fred designed and implemented the UX apprenticeship program at The Nerdery in Minneapolis, MN.</p>
              <p>Fred is also known for being an outspoken advocate for iterative design methods, especially prototyping. In 2007, he authored the first official Axure training program, which he ran until 2012. He has written numerous articles and blog posts on prototyping and iterative design, and he has spoken on these topics at design conferences worldwide.</p>

              <p>Jared M. Spool is the founder of User Interface Engineering, the largest usability research organization of its kind in the world. If you&#8217;ve ever seen Jared speak about user experience design, you know that he&#8217;s probably the most effective and knowledgeable communicator on the subject today. He&#8217;s been working in the field of usability and experience design since 1978, before the term &#8220;usability&#8221; was ever associated with computers.</p>
              <p>Jared spends his time working with the research teams at the company, helps clients understand how to solve their design problems, explains to reporters and industry analysts what the current state of design is all about, and is a top-rated speaker at more than 20 conferences every year. He is also the conference chair and keynote speaker at the annual UI Conference and UX Immersion Conference, and manages to squeeze in a fair amount of writing time. He is author of the book, Web Usability: A Designer&#8217;s Guide and co-author of Web Anatomy: Interaction Design Frameworks that Work.</p>

              <h3>Adventures in Prototyping: How To Make Simple, Solid HTML/CSS Prototypes</h3>
              <p>You need a prototype and you need it fast. Chances are, you&#8217;d also like it to look nice, be built on solid code and represent both the functionality and feel of the final intended product. With a good foundational knowledge of cutting-edge markup practices, design principles and readily available tools, it is in fact possible. This presentation will provide a look at the static site generators and style frameworks available, how to pick the right ones for your projects, and the process of using them to create quick, beautiful, representative prototypes.</p>

              <p>Mari Luangrath is best known for her dynamic speaking style, in which she shares stories about starting and growing Chicago&#8217;s Foiled Cupcakes. Starting the company using social media as its only form of advertising, Mari grew the business to revenue numbers 600 percent higher than originally projected.</p>
              <p>Even without a traditional storefront, Foiled Cupcakes is Chicago&#8217;s most buzzed about cupcake operation. By marketing via Twitter and Facebook (totally by accident), Foiled is now Chicago&#8217;s cupcake darling, comfortably positioning themselves as the corporate go-to for sweet treats thanks to social media.</p>
              <p>A sought-after international speaker and featured on national media outlets (Investors Business Daily, Wall Street Journal, Entrepreneur Magazine, Business Week, to name a few), Mari&#8217;s authenticity and passion towards business strategy and networking has resulted in an impressive client list, including over 100 Fortune 500 companies.</p>
              <h3>Prototyping Cupcakes: Taking Delicious from Local to National</h3>
              <p>Now shipping their sweets nationally, Foiled has undertaken their biggest challenge to date&#8211;sending delicious cupcakes in a box, while keeping the product and brand experience rich and unique&#8230; and still remaining competitive from a cost perspective. Mari and her team have successfully navigated this space, using pastry experience, customer data, trial and error, storymapping, and a strategic partnership with one of the biggest pharmaceutical shipping companies in the world&#8211;in order to do so profitably.</p>

              <p>As a designer or developer, keeping up with and growing your skillset can be challenging. However, figuring out what to do with those skills once you have them can be even more difficult. In this presentation, we&#8217;ll explore ways to come up with ideas that can lead to enhancing your work and workflow, shipping those ideas even when they aren&#8217;t perfect, and creating things that other people might even pay to use.</p>

              <h3>Interactive Prototyping: Avoiding the Fidelity Cliff</h3>
              <p>Interactive Prototyping is the next big Ux skill, but many designers may avoid embracing it. Prototyping can become needlessly complex, requiring designers to know when they&#8217;ve designed enough, and it&#8217;s time to start building. In this session, Jason will explain some of the most common pitfalls with interactive prototyping, how they can be avoided, and why it&#8217;s never been more important for designers to learn how to create working prototypes.</p>

              <h3>Deciding What to Build Without Killing Each Other</h3>
              <p>Deciding what to build is hard. Making the decision as a team is even tougher. Team members often have differing views on which portions of the prototype are most important and what functionality to include. Tensions from the decision-making process can drive teams apart. In our labs group we have adopted a framework for making prototyping and project decisions. This presentation outlines the framework we use in Sabre Labs, as well as some examples of times we&#8217;ve gotten it right, and other times we haven&#8217;t.</p>

              <h3>Well-Designed Travel</h3>
              <p>About two years ago, my partner and I left behind our Chicago home and nearly everything we owned to pursue a fanciful life of nomadic travel. We had flexible jobs where working from home was considered normal, so we wondered why couldn&#8217;t home be anywhere we want it to be? This lifestyle (though not without its challenges), has enabled us to visit new places, learn new languages, skip winters and spend time with the friends and family that we rarely got to see in our formerly stationary lives.</p>
              <p>The way we go about our day-to-day life on the road has been informed and made better by many of the development practices we already had, particularly in terms of prototyping. We continually strive for tight feedback loops so that we are free to try new things and quickly adapt. In our case we work for continual incremental improvement in our skills, our experiences, and our ability to connect with others to arrive at the most intentional and rewarding life that we know how to live.</p>

              <h3>Co-Designing with the Client: Using Axure to Bring Requirements to Life</h3>
              <p>Axure is a great tool to use to help move from a high-level list of requirements into functional concepting. Gabby will present an actual case study of how she used Axure to winnow down a 5-page list of requirements into a working prototype by co-designing with her client. Moving from whiteboard and pencil sketches into Axure, and refining on the go, we were able to get to a pretty decent prototype that gave visual designers the room to be creative, while adhering to the functional goals of the site.</p>

              <h3>The Right Type of Prototype</h3>
              <p>How do you know what to prototype? What details are important to get right? What level of interactivity is necessary to get valid feedback?</p>
              <p>Prototypes are very effective tools for playing out ideas, testing concepts and getting feedback. But they are often left out of the design and development cycles due to their disposable nature. It can be tough to justify the effort to make something for the purpose of experiment. Finding the right prototype medium and minimum level of detail required is essential. Without it, how will you get the stakeholder buy-in and funding?</p>
              <p>Learn how to match your prototype fidelity to the information you need to gather. Understand the range of prototype techniques and match them to your situation. Get maximum value and minimize your project risk.</p>
