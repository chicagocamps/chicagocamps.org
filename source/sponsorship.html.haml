    %p This one is just a little bit different&ndash;we typically require assistance with a lot of the local, on-the-ground needs. This includes help locating an ideal venue and/or venue sponsor, assistance marketing to the community to ensure the event is a success, identifying local talent, and so on.

    %p Speaker Camp is our most requested, most-traveled event and generally requires some form of travel/lodging sponsorship and a secured location sponsor that can hold 40-60 people and that has at least 2 additional rooms with A/V connections. Additionally, we typically require assistance marketing locally to ensure that we can achieve no less than 20 attendees for the event in order to do our best to break even.

    %p Improving the diversity at technology events is very important to us&ndash;if you&#8217;re interested in bringing Speaker Camp to your town, please reach out and we&#8217;ll work with you to try to make it happen!
