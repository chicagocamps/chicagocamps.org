Howdy! The Chicago Camps team has been a pretty busy group lately. When we started in 2012, we were just throwing together a Prototype Camp event because we loved the idea, and we wanted to do something cool in the Chicago technology community. READMORE

Then 2013 rolled around and we started stretching ourselves a bit&#8211;we put on more events and started learning how to pull them off a little more fluidly, and work together as a team. In 2014, we started trying some new things&#8211;we introduced workshops and podcasts and started taking Speaker Camp on the road to Atlanta and Boston. We had a lot of fun, and we also created a bunch of different places on the web to house all of these events and media, and, well, frankly, our house was a mess.

We had websites all over the place. Content in multiple places. Dependencies were high when really, any one of us should have been able to make simple updates to our websites, events, and media. We experienced growth in a way that we didn&#8217;t plan for, didn&#8217;t think through, and the experience really kind of showed it. 

At the end of 2014, we took a breath. We thought things through and decided to pull all of our events&#8211;camps and workshops&#8211;as well as media (podcasts, news updates) under one roof.

As we head in to 2015, we feel a bit better prepared for any future growth&#8211;be that events, media, or some oddball side project we want to see if we can spin up through Chicago Camps. We&#8217;ll still keep some of our old domain names around and point them to their appropriate websites, however, for the most part everything is going to be under one roof on the internet, with the exception of Prototypes, Process &amp; Play which will have its own website and experience as it&#8217;s just different enough from the other events that we host to merit its own home. We may, of course, re-think that as we continue to learn how this all works.

We&#8217;re excited about this move; it&#8217;s great to feel like everything we do is in one place. It&#8217;s easier to think about, and much easier for us to be able to launch a new event somewhere without a lot of overhead and dependencies, and that helps us work faster and smarter.

We thank you all for hanging in there with us, too! We&#8217;d not be able to still continue doing these events without your attendance and feedback, and we deeply appreciate that!

Here&#8217;s to 2015!

Brad, Shay, &amp; Russ
