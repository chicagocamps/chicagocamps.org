    %h2 UX Camp: Home Edition is a 1-day mini-conference delivering design goodness to you, where ever you may be.

    %p <strong>On Saturday, June 13, 2020, from where ever you are</strong>&mdash;be that a deck, a patio, a kitchen table playing double-duty as a home office, couch with someone crawling all over you, or some place close enough to someone else&#8217;s wifi to make it free to access (and far enough away to make it not awkward, bud), we&#8217;re serving up 2 awesome keynotes that bookend 4 really great presentations!

    %p <strong>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago</strong> for some (hopefully) nice weather, great views, city sounds, and then the abundant food and snacks that we like to provide from the comfort of Columbia College Film Row.

    %p <strong>Things are different now, and we want to do something that is great for our community</strong>, spreads to the broader community, and still provides opportunity for presenters to present and attendees to learn. We&#8217;re giving this a shot, and we hope you&#8217;ll give us a shot, too!

    %p <strong>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing:</strong>

    %ul.list-ul
      %li The first 20 tickets to UX Camp: Home Edition are only $5!
      %li The rest of the UX Camp: Home Edition tickets are $10!

    %p <strong>And you know, we thought we should do better, especially now.</strong> So here&#8217;s what else we&#8217;re doing:

    %ul.list-ul
      %li <strong>We&#8217;ve got a pool of &#8220;Need 1, Take 1&#8221; tickets</strong> that are available to anyone who has been impacted by COVID-19 in anyway and wants to attend.
      %li <strong>We&#8217;ve also got a &#8220;Pay What You Can&#8221; option</strong> (starting at $2; we pay the fees) that anyone can take advantage of

    %p We&#8217;re happy that we&#8217;re able to do this; it feels good. And we want others to also feel good, so we&#8217;re doing more:

    %ul.list-ul
      %li Anyone can purchase a &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221; ticket for someone else who may need it.
      %li Anyone can purchase a UX Camp: Home Edition t-shirt from Nerditees for $12&mdash;and we&#8217;ll add another &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221; ticket to the pool.

      = image_tag "events/ux-camp-home-edition-tshirt.png", alt: "UX Camp: Home Edition t-shirt", class: "grid-1-2"
    
    %p We are continually looking for additional ways to make this a special event.

      %h3 The 10 Principles of Effective Wireframes

      %p Wireframing should be a part of every digital design project and each team should have a hand in making them. You don&#8217;t even need a computer to create great wireframes—a sketch on a white board works just as well if you&#8217;re doing it right. And what is doing it right? I&#8217;ve identified 10 principles that can help make the daily life of working on digital products a bit easier. 

      %p There are lots of teams working together to create products, however only one seems to properly communicate to everyone visually: The design team. We all encounter problems in our everyday life and there are times when we devise solutions to fix those problems, and that is a design. And that, indeed, makes us all designers. In this presentation, I will explore why everyone should wireframe and tips on how to make the wireframing process a collaborative success.

      %h3 Research Your Team First: Key Communication Techniques to Build Trust &amp; Clarity in Product Teams

      %p Instead of trying to &#8220;win&#8221; an argument, what if we invested in understanding our counterparts&#8217; and stakeholders&#8217; needs first with the goal of building their trust? We are passionate about our work, and in collaborative environments, we need to align our differing views of user needs, innovative ideas, and product vision across disciplines and management levels. This often means we spend a lot of time pitching our concepts for adoption into a product roadmap.

      %p In this talk, you will learn communication techniques to uncover the key problems that cross-functional teams can rally around. We will also cover how to apply these techniques to help our teams feel more prepared for conversations about project scope, priority shifts, and even work-place conflicts.

      %h3 Design for Interaction: Using Animation to Enhance User Experience

      %p Modern browsers, JavaScript libraries, and CSS3 have made it easier than ever to create exciting, dynamic animated experiences within web interfaces. But we have also seen the unfortunate side effect of trying to do too much: websites that are resource hogs, eating up bandwidth and slowing load times to a crawl, all for effects that are ultimately just there for the &#8220;show&#8221; factor. 

      %p This talk will discuss how to use these animation skills for good: to establish context, convey status, give feedback, and yes, even add a little delight. Along the way, we&#8217;ll discuss the principles of animation that guide everything from your favorite feature films to the actions of a button on your screen, and learn how deliberate animation choices can improve the experience for your user. We will also touch on the available tools in JS and CSS and how to choose which one is the right one for your animation task.
