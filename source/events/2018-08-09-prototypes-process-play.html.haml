      %h3 The Accidental Design Leader

      %p Andy first came to prominence in our industry as a designer and web standards enthusiast. He was driven by a desire to improve and professionalise the industry, which is how he came to start the UKs first user experience consultancy, Clearleft. He never set out to be a design leader, but now find himself leading a team of thirty people, almost by accident. 

      %p In a quest to understand what makes a great leader, and help his friends in newly minted leadership positions, Andy started the Leading Design conference and Slack community. Over the past 18 months, Andy has interviewed dozens of prominent leaders and listened in on hundreds of Slack conversations about the art and craft of leadership. 

      %p In this session, Andy recounts his journey into leadership, shares his successes and failures, and the important lessons he&#8217;s learned on the way. The result is a talk packed full of design leadership heuristics suitable for leaders of all shapes, sizes, levels and seniorities.

      %h3 A Tale of Two Kickstarters
      
      %p Have you ever wondered what it would be like to take your big idea and run a Kickstarter campaign? Have you ever wondered why the heck those Kickstarters you funded took so long, didn&#8217;t deliver as expected, or in general frustrated you?

      %p I&#8217;m going to walk you through what it&#8217;s like to go through our first Kickstarter&ndash;and share with you all the things we learned along the way. By the time this event happens, we&#8217;ll have also gone through a second campaign, and if it&#8217;s successful or fails dramatically, I&#8217;ll have even more of a story to share!

      %h3 Responsive Design Leadership &mdash; One Style Does Not Fit All
      
      %p Not everyone wants or needs a warm, supportive manager, and not everyone wants or needs the tough, task-focused boss. I&#8217;ve come to realize that my usual style of mentoring and motivating people on my teams does not work for everyone, much to my dismay.  There are many shades of leadership in between, and knowing what each team member needs means discovering the answers to deeper questions about what makes them who they are.

      %p You&#8217;ll need to uncover what inspires and motivates each individual team member, while also understanding how they&#8217;ll respond to ambiguity or sudden change. You&#8217;ll also need to do this while handling your day job and while also keeping them&ndash;and yourself&ndash;from burning out. We&#8217;ll discuss some approaches to tackling most of this (that burn out one&hellip;) and share tips on empathy and emotional resonance that can help you build stronger and more genuine ties to your team in order to set them all up for their best success.

      %h3 Where Is My Mind? &ndash; Risking Security &amp; Finding Sanity by Leaving Big Business for Small Design

      %p Have you ever wondered if you could be the boss? Not just the manager, or the design leader, but someone who is ultimately responsible for decisions that shape the success or failure of your company? I&#8217;m going to tell you about my journey to become the boss, and share the lessons I&#8217;ve learned about accepting risk, finding value, creating worth, and seeing benefit in the design field. 

      %p Something tells me that this is the type of thing that gets easier the second time, but, to me, there were no do-overs in this adventure. It involved going all-in and gambling without a safety net. Along the way, I&#8217;ve found myself pondering a second mortgage to keep the lights on, losing employees and clients at the worst times, riding project highs followed by periods of drought, and somehow constantly running out of bourbon.

      %p And this was exactly what I had been looking for. Maybe it&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for too, so I&#8217;ve got some stories for you.

      %h3 Rock Chalk! From Dust to Design
      
      %p Have you ever wondered how an artist makes a living&ndash;not just the ones with galleries, the other ones that you see when you go to conventions, or peruse Etsy for unique items to add to your collection of whatever-it-is-you-collect? Have you ever thought about taking a passion project and making it less about passion and more real?

      %p This is what I do! I create art, using chalk (yes, that chalk), and you&#8217;ll see me creating it live at any number of fan conventions, and then I turn it into something you&#8217;d be proud to frame and hang on your wall! It&#8217;s a lot of fun&ndash;and a lot of work&ndash;to make this type of thing work. For some it&#8217;s a hobby, for some it&#8217;s a full time job. For me, it&#8217;s taking an idea and turning it into art, and finding ways to make art make money.

      %h3 Audio Autopsy: How&#8217;d My Favorite Podcast Do That?

      %p Making podcasts isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart and I&#8217;m here to tell you why‚Äîwe&#8217;ll take a shallow-dive into the craft of audio storytelling via podcasting, and the production that goes into it. Podcasts are hot‚Äîpeople aren&#8217;t leaving the house before making sure they have their phone, keys, wallet, and earbuds connected with their favorite show queued-up. I&#8217;m going to tell you how that all happens!

      %h3 DESIGN BOSS: Leading UX in the Enterprise 

      %p Leading design in a large organization is more than just &#8220;doing design with more people.&#8221; Anyone who tells you otherwise has yet to spend their time untangling a myriad of non-design-related issues so that design work can get done. Huge teams, competing priorities, personal agendas, and outdated methodologies can make innovation seem impossible, and can discourage even the most optimistic practitioners. 

      %p Some planning, some data, and a whole lot of patience will help you develop strong relationships with your product, marketing, and technology partners, create advocates across the organization, and communicate the value your team brings to the organization. If only that were all there is to the job!

      %p Yes, design leader, it&#8217;s entirely possible to inspire teams, drive change, and create meaningful digital experiences in an enterprise environment. It&#8217;s not always easy, and there&#8217;s no single path to success&ndash;let&#8217;s start with what I&#8217;ve learned to point you in the right direction.

      %h3 Inheriting a Mess: The Life Changing Magic of Disorder

      %p Despite widespread praise for experimentation and play, &#8220;mess&#8221; still remains an insult in business books and home design blogs alike. Inheriting an organizational mess means taking on someone else&#8217;s disorder, clutter, and ongoing difficulties. Who would thank a predecessor for bequeathing them that? 

      %p You, that&#8217;s who. In this talk, I&#8217;ll argue for embracing mess as a powerful tool in organizational (re)design. As well, I&#8217;ll walk through some some principles and practices for putting mess to work without letting it take over.

      %h3 The Leaders Guide to the Care &amp; Feeding of Humans

      %p Health and wellness of an organization&#8217;s or project&#8217;s performance can be relatively simple. In a snapshot we can know a lot&ndash;dashboards and metrics tell us lots about how well our work is progressing, what mile stones we&#8217;re reaching, and what color-coded alert state of panic we should be in. And we can optimize our way into just about any green-colored diagram we choose.

      %p Teams, and the humans that comprise them, are fascinatingly complex and complicated. In a snapshot, we can fool ourselves into believing all kinds of things about them. And yet, we can&#8217;t really know for sure unless we dive in deeper and learn about their health, their needs, and try to help them optimize for their individual successes. In this presentation, Kara shares her approach to the care and feeding of humans, sharing lessons gleaned from working at the highest echelons of sports, entertainment, government, and technology.

      %h3 Context/Leader Fit

      %p Any seasoned designer or PM knows the importance of context: users, goals, environments, and business needs all shape the &#8220;best&#8221; solution to a given problem. And yet, designers and leaders frequently assume that a process, skill set, or attitude that worked in one place is the one right answer. Kim will discuss:

        %li How to assess your leadership effectiveness within a given context
        %li How to find your own context/leader fit

      %h3 Coach, Diplomat, Advocate, Architect: The Complete Design Leader

      %p A challenge many designers face as they embrace leadership is learning how to let go of the work. All through their career, their success has been measured by their ability to deliver. Now they have to figure out how to shift their efforts to support the delivery of their teams. This may lead to an existential crisis &ndash; &#8220;If I&#8217;m not doing the work, how am I contributing value?&#8221;

      %p In this talk, Peter will outline the four archetypes of the Complete Design Leader. This leader grows their design team, provides clear expectations, and does everything they can to ensure the team&#8217;s effectiveness. These leaders must broaden their purview beyond creative matters, into the managerial and operational activities that will enable their team to succeed.

      %h3 Moving You &mdash; The Work That Goes Into DJing

      %p Music is magical&ndash;it can make us move, it can move us, it can make us forget everything for a moment, and it can make us remember things we thought we&#8217;d forgotten forever. There&#8217;s even more magic that happens when a DJ gets in the zone and makes you experience all of that for a long period of time.

      %p How does it happen That thing where you were singing and dancing along to something familiar one moment and the next you&#8217;re experiencing something completely different‚Äîyet similar‚Äîand you&#8217;re not sure when it happened.

      %p I do that, and I can promise you, it&#8217;s all by design. It takes a deep knowledge of and appreciation for music, a passion for helping others experience something great for them and created by you, and it takes precision timing and skill to keep everything going. We&#8217;ll hear and see some live DJ action, and then I&#8217;ll slow it all down and we&#8217;ll deconstruct it so you can learn all that happens when the music beat goes on and the DJs appear to be switching to glide.

      %h3 Designing the Team Experience: Building Culture Through Onboarding

      %p Why do some project teams work well, while others just can&#8217;t seem to get it together? Why do some teams have a strong sense of culture while others feel like a group of strangers working on the same task? 

      %p When a team comes together, whether it&#8217;s for a short-term project or ongoing long-term operations, a culture emerges: you can see it in how the team works toward common goals and how they interact with one another. Although you can&#8217;t force team culture, you can design for it. Through an enterprise project case study, we&#8217;ll look at onboarding techniques and methods that can be used to deliberately build strong team cultures.
