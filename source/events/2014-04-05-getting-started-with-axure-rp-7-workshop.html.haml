category: events
alias: axure-rp-7-workshop
summary: This one-day, hands-on workshop is designed for those who want to learn how this powerful rapid prototyping tool can be used to create clickable HTML-based prototypes so they can more clearly communicate their visual and interaction designs to stakeholders and end users. Unlike tools that create static wireframes, <a href="http://www.axure.com/" rel="nofollow">Axure RP 7</a> lets user experience designers create highly interactive prototypes that can be used in web browsers and on mobile devices without having to write any code.

    %h2 Getting Started With Axure RP 7

    %p This one-day, hands-on workshop is designed for those who want to learn how this powerful rapid prototyping tool can be used to create clickable HTML-based prototypes so they can more clearly communicate their visual and interaction designs to stakeholders and end users. Unlike tools that create static wireframes, <a href="http://www.axure.com/" rel="nofollow">Axure RP 7</a> lets user experience designers create highly interactive prototypes that can be used in web browsers and on mobile devices without having to write any code.

    %p This workshop will get you up and running (or refreshed on the new Axure 7!) with a mixture of examples, tutorials, and exercises that start with static wireframes and then advance to interactive prototypes that use forms and variables to capture user input and update the interface based on user actions. You will take home working Axure RP 7 files that you build in the workshop. These project files include the functions you&#8217;ll need get up and running with the latest version of this extremely popular prototyping solution.
