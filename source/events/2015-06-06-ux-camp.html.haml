      %h3 Questioning Default Design Decisions

      %p &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s how [another company] does it.&#8221;

      %p It&#8217;s easy to default to common design patterns when building a product, but that doesn&#8217;t mean those are the right choices for your software. This talk will discuss some of these common patterns and show alternative options.

      %h3 Experience Innovation &#8212; The New Design Imperative
       
      %p We live in a world where technology is making almost everything possible. Companies are no longer standing head and shoulders above their competition when it comes to the latest features. The TV industry is a great example&#8230; TVs are commodities; every new model that a company like LG releases, there are 2 or 3 competitors like Samsung or Toshiba that can match them feature for feature. In 2013 the Global Innovation 1000 survey showed that product R&D spending rose 5.8% in the last year, yet revenue for those companies increased less than 1%.
       
      %p Enter experience innovation &#8212; this is becoming the most important element in smart companies product lifecycle. They are starting to use experience innovation to remain relevant and retain customer loyalty. Companies like Uber, Delta Airlines, Disney and Nike, to name a few, are figuring out ways to create signature moments that delight users and create significant opportunities for growth. They have learned how to look beyond their products to and see the broader experience their customers have when using their products and services. Look at Virgin Airlines for example. They figured out that they could only do so much to affect their customers&#8217; experience in the air, so what they did is create the Virgin Airport Clubs to make the wait for a flight way more enjoyable. They saw a 11% uptick in ticket sales and a 34% decrease in customer complaints after establishing these clubs. They figured out how to affect the overall experience their customers were having in a positive way and to a mutual benefit.
       
      %p I have come up with a list of 6 things that we as UXers can do to get our clients or our companies we work for to start innovating experiences. I will share with you examples of how others have done it and how I have led a UX team in a giant engineering organization like Johnson Controls to innovate and impact our business directly. Ultimately we need to start doing this for the companies we work for or for our clients. Experience innovation is not a new idea and it only a matter of time before your company&#8217;s or client&#8217;s competition figures it out.

      %h3 Designing Digital Communities

      %p As the architectural complexities and user expectations of websites continue to evolve, viewing them as the communities that they are&#8211;or can become&#8211;is increasingly important to both their sustainability and success. How do we as technologists design, build, and maintain these properties; while also evolving the tools we use to support them? 

      %p We&#8217;ll look at:

      %ul.list-ul
        %li Design patterns, development processes and feedback cycles
        %li How Threadless has worked to foster collaboration between users and developers by encouraging both active and passive participation
        %li How to best leverage a community&#8217;s shared assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating digital spaces that promote users&#8217; sense of inclusion and satisfaction
        %li Looking at existing real world design patterns (e.g. universal iconography and visual wayfinding) as a means of creating more accessible user experiences in a digital space
        %li Responsible development: pushing design and technology forward without dragging users behind you

      %h3 WHAT Before HOW: Practical, Lo-fi Tools for Alignment, Planning, &amp; Understanding

      %p Budgets and deadlines often push us toward making and doing before we have a shared understanding of the problem space. Here we will explore a handful of lightweight techniques from an information architecture perspective that can compliment your existing UX toolkit. 

      %p These approaches will help frame your design activities first in terms of WHAT would be good to do, setting you up to create even better HOWs.
