    %h2 UX Camp: Home Edition is a 1-day mini-conference delivering design goodness to you, where ever you may be.

    %p <strong>On Saturday, April 3, 2021 at 10AM CT, from where ever you are</strong>&mdash;we&#8217;re serving up 2 awesome keynotes that bookend up to 12 (3 tracks) really great presentations!

    %p <strong>Interested in getting on a virtual stage?</strong> <a href="/proposal">Submit your talk idea!</a>

    %p <strong>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago</strong> for some (hopefully) nice weather, great views, city sounds, and then the abundant food and snacks that we like to provide from the comfort of Columbia College Film Row.

    %p <strong>Things are different now, and we want to do something that is great for our community</strong>, spreads to the broader community, and still provides opportunity for presenters to present and attendees to learn. We&#8217;re giving this a shot, and we hope you&#8217;ll give us a shot, too!

      %h3 Building Character: Creating Unique, Consistent Experiences with Design Principles
    
      %p Inconsistency is one of the most common points of breakdown and frustration in the interactions and experiences we have. Whether we&#8217;re interacting with other people, apps, our bank, our doctor, our government, anyone&mdash;we form expectations of what someone or something will do based on our previous experiences and their past behaviors. When something happens that doesn&#8217;t measure up to those expectations–that seems out of character–we&#8217;re caught off guard. What do we do next? What should we expect now?

      %p Conversations about consistency in design often focus on topics like content and interface design, ensuring that we use the same labels, controls, patterns throughout our creations. But what if we thought about  consistency in the relationship between users and our products or services?
     
      %p Principles act as rules that guide how we think and act. Formed by our motivations, values and beliefs, we use them as &#8220;lenses&#8221; through which we examine information in order to make decisions on what to do. And because of their persistent influence on our behavior, they influence other&#8217;s views and expectations of us. Using these same kinds of constructs throughout the design process we can design unique content, valuable  interactions and consistent behaviors that set and live up to expectations for our audiences.

      %h3 Making Creativity Out of Masked Air: How To Stay Relentlessly Creative Through a Pandemic And Beyond
    
      %p So many of the things we used to rely on to fuel our creativity before the pandemic&mdash;meeting new people, traveling, visiting museums&mdash;have been off-limits for many of us over the past year. Staying creative can feel nearly impossible—and fear not: there&#8217;s hope.

      %p I&#8217;ve developed a framework for boosting your creativity no matter the circumstances. I&#8217;ll share how to harness your curiosity as a focal point, and how to break that down and to help identify ways to reignite your creativity. The process infused my life with renewed energy that sparked my creativity&mdash;from my sketchbook to my day job and even on to receiving a promotion!

      %h3 Building Confident Users in the Space Between
    
      %p Siloed organizations aren&#8217;t incentivized to improve the space between products, despite the massive opportunity it presents. Seizing that opportunity is as much community organization as it is design.

      %p Enterprise customers increasingly interact with multiple products from the same company. From rapid acquisitions to market opportunities, companies are frequently introducing products and services that are ostensibly interconnected. Users can transfer knowledge of existing product mechanics and flows to new ones, resulting in faster adoption and time-to-value—but that won&#8217;t happen by accident.

      %p I&#8217;ll show how we&#8217;ve managed these efforts at Salesforce: how we built momentum internally, enlisted stakeholders, co-created, made decisions, and set ourselves up for constant improvement.

      %h3 Using Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy to Design for Minorities

      %p Have you ever found yourself at a loss for what to say in response to &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why we need to point out race&hellip; we&#8217;re all humans here?&#8221; Have you ever stood in line at the coffee shop, and overheard a heated argument, but went back and forth between wanting to stand up for the person being yelled at and thinking it was none of your business? Have you ever caught yourself in a situation where you just couldn&#8217;t tell if someone was being racist or not?

      %p If you answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to any of these questions, then you&#8217;ll understand why Allied Voices was formed. We&#8217;re a platform that enables you to navigate your racial landscape by reading other people&#8217;s stories of similar incidents, and how they handled them.

      %p Join us as we dive into how an Uber ride initially inspired the project, how we addressed the issue of coming off as tone-deaf in initially only addressing Asian-American struggles, how we took user trust into consideration (as we made design decisions on the way we displayed different types of content), and what surprising takeaways we found through rigorous user testing.

      %p You&#8217;ll walk away with a new understanding of how to use your design skills for social impact, and how to approach, and even embrace, uncomfortable conversations as a designer.

      %h3 Designing Through Imposter Syndrome: Using a Goal-based Framework to Navigate Career Growth in Design
    
      %p The design industry doesn&#8217;t make it easy for any of us to be designers—and it can seem even more challenging to be a great designer. We all want to do great work; however, great design is subjective! We all want to grow our skills, and our industry is riddled with tool debates, in-fighting about who is a designer, who should code, and any number of other competing viewpoints that make it difficult to know if you&#8217;re on the right path. 

      %p Design, the noun, verb, and industry, can leave even the strongest of us doubting ourselves and wondering what we need to do next. I&#8217;ve struggled with imposter syndrome, and through the reflection of my own experiences transitioning from development to design, I&#8217;ll share the framework that is helping me find my growth path so you can tailor it to meet your needs, and target the future that makes the most sense for you.
