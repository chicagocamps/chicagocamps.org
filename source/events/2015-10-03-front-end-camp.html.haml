      %h3 Design Through the Lens of Developer Eyes

      %p The discussions in digital workflow have focused on the expectation of the designer communicating and thinking like a developer, an artifact of the waterfall workflow. The dynamic of the emerging workflow, repositions the conversations away from the canon and invites others to use empathy when collaborating on projects. Within this talk I&#8217;ll cover how I, as a developer, communicate through the perspective of a designer and how making a designers life easier makes the current, and future, projects easier to manage.
