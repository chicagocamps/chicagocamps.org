    %h2 UX Camp: Home Edition is a 1-day mini-conference delivering design goodness to you, where ever you may be.

    %p <strong>On Saturday, June 5, 2021 at 10AM CT, from where ever you are</strong>&mdash;we&#8217;re serving up 2 awesome keynotes that bookend up to 12 (3 tracks) really great presentations!

    %p <strong>Interested in getting on a virtual stage?</strong> <a href="/proposal">Submit your talk idea!</a>

    %p <strong>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago</strong> for some (hopefully) nice weather, great views, city sounds, and then the abundant food and snacks that we like to provide from the comfort of Columbia College Film Row.

    %p <strong>Things are different now, and we want to do something that is great for our community</strong>, spreads to the broader community, and still provides opportunity for presenters to present and attendees to learn. We&#8217;re giving this a shot, and we hope you&#8217;ll give us a shot, too!

      %h3 Humility: The Designer&#8217;s Most Essential Trait
      
      %p Humility is essential to doing our best work. Why? Effective visual communication and intuitive UX are not subjective; every objective design decision we make carries weight, and is bigger than us. We must understand the privilege, and the responsibility, that are inherent in our craft. 

      %p And, in communicating. In <em>connecting</em> with people through design.

      %p When there are clear project goals to be reached and problems to be solved, having a willingness to listen, learn, understand, grow, evolve, and connect will fuel you&ndash;and your design&#8217;s&ndash;evolution.

      %p If we are always students of our craft, we are always making ourselves available to evolve. &#8220;Experience&#8221; does not equal &#8220;expert&#8221;, despite having a monogrammed portfolio or a blue checkbox next to your Twitter handle. 

      %p Through the lens of vulnerability of a career&#8217;s journey inclusive of early success, and the resulting effects on his design and personal growth, join Justin Dauer as he talks through how the human connection must always lead in evolving ourselves as designers, our work, and our career&#8217;s journey. We can&#8217;t settle for anything less: you, your work, and those on the receiving end of what you create, <em>deserve</em> nothing less.
