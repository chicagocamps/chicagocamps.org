    %h2 UX Camp: Home Edition is a 1-day mini-conference delivering design goodness to you, where ever you may be.

    %p <strong>On Saturday, October 17, 2020 at 10AM CT, from where ever you are</strong>&mdash;we&#8217;re serving up 2 awesome keynotes that bookend up to 12 (3 tracks) really great presentations!

    %p <strong>Interested in getting on a virtual stage?</strong> <a href="/proposal">Submit your talk idea!</a>

    %p <strong>Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago</strong> for some (hopefully) nice weather, great views, city sounds, and then the abundant food and snacks that we like to provide from the comfort of Columbia College Film Row.

    %p <strong>Things are different now, and we want to do something that is great for our community</strong>, spreads to the broader community, and still provides opportunity for presenters to present and attendees to learn. We&#8217;re giving this a shot, and we hope you&#8217;ll give us a shot, too!

    %p <strong>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing:</strong>

    %ul.list-ul
      %li The first 20 tickets to UX Camp: Home Edition are only $5!
      %li The rest of the UX Camp: Home Edition tickets are $10!

    %p <strong>And you know, we thought we should do better, especially now.</strong> So here&#8217;s what else we&#8217;re doing:

    %ul.list-ul
      %li <strong>We&#8217;ve got a pool of &#8220;Need 1, Take 1&#8221; tickets</strong> that are available to anyone who has been impacted by COVID-19 in anyway and wants to attend.
      %li <strong>We&#8217;ve also got a &#8220;Pay What You Can&#8221; option</strong> (starting at $2; we pay the fees) that anyone can take advantage of

    %p We&#8217;re happy that we&#8217;re able to do this; it feels good. And we want others to also feel good, so we&#8217;re doing more:

    %ul.list-ul
      %li Anyone can purchase a &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221; ticket for someone else who may need it.
      %li Anyone can purchase a UX Camp: Home Edition t-shirt from Nerditees for $12&mdash;and we&#8217;ll add another &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221; ticket to the pool.

      %h3 Stop Planning Your Career &amp; Start Taking Action

      %p 5-year career plans are supposed to align you and your manager on a path to a bright and shiny future, one where you&#8217;ve achieved your goals through a combination of skill and perseverance. Instead, they set you up for failure by closing your mind to the opportunities right in front of you.

      %p The person you are today has abilities, limitations, and nemeses that you didn&#8217;t predict for yourself 5 years ago. And the role you&#8217;ll have 5 years from now, can&#8217;t be decided just by looking at the jobs that exist today.

      %p Instead of making a 5-year-plan, start planning for what&#8217;s next. 

      %p In this keynote, you&#8217;ll learn how to identify the work that fuels you, reflect on the principles that guide your preferences, consider the upsides of spite, and identify the people who will support you as you take the next step in your career.

      %h3 Usage Maturity Matrix: A Tool for Making User-Centered Design Decisions within Project Constraints

      %p Project constraints often challenge our ability to meet user needs. With a usage maturity matrix, which shows a user&#8217;s comfort and familiarity with, and degree of use of a product, process or place, as our guide we are better able to focus our design efforts where our users and our business stakeholders need us most. 

      %p In this presentation, you&#8217;ll learn what a usage maturity matrix is and how to create one. This powerful tool can influence which features and functions we design into our present projects and can serve as a lasting guide impacting our ongoing design roadmap.

      %h3 &#8220;Du&#8221; Good: How UXers Can Help Change Our Companies &amp; Communities

      %p As UX practitioners we pride ourselves on human-centered design, but do we really practice what we preach when statistics continually reflect a staggering lack of diversity? Even in a pandemic, studies show industry leaders predict an increased demand for UX design professionals. 

      %p You&#8217;ve protested. You&#8217;ve made public statements to do better. Now you&#8217;re probably asking, &#8220;What now?&#8221; Learn how companies can start to fulfill their promises to create a more diverse UX design workforce. Corporate volunteerism is also a way for companies to empower employees to continue the fight against systemic racism by enabling your UX staff to support community organizations in need of our digital skills. As an example, this talk will include work as a skills-based volunteer for the DuSable Museum of African American history and how we collaborated with museum staff to develop the digital marketing campaign, &#8220;this is What We Du.&#8221;

      %h3 Increase Your Design Influence By Understanding Your Organization&#8217;s Decision-making Style

      %p As designers, we like to think of ourselves as makers. When we&#8217;re working on large, wicked problems, the challenge is that “making” is no longer a solo endeavor; it&#8217;s something that requires a lot of people and functionality to make happen. This can leave designers feeling like we&#8217;ve had to compromise our standards to appease business or development stakeholders. It also inadvertently creates an us-versus-them mentality that actually makes it less likely that we&#8217;ll be successful in moving forward our vision of what&#8217;s possible.

      %p So what does this mean for us? Simply understanding what your product&#8217;s users are dealing with isn&#8217;t enough. To make truly great products, you need to understand how people, organizations, systems and content play together. In this presentation, we&#8217;ll focus on some ways to help understand the organizational context you&#8217;re working within, and to adjust your approach to increase your success within those organizations.

      %h3 5 Ways to Ensure Web Accessibility (and Avoid Legal Trouble)
    
      %p What do Beyonc&eacute;, Domino&#8217;s Pizza, and Amazon have in common? They have all been sued for non-compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. And they are not alone. Kevin will share 5 ways to ensure your web site is accessible (and can avoid legal trouble) and will discuss what ADA and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines guidelines are. 

      %p UsableNet has found on average, one web site-based lawsuit is filed every hour. This presentation asks and answers: Who is suing and why? What are the consequences? Why is it happening and what can be done about it? Kevin will highlight which groups are served by web accessibility, outline ways to achieve the WCAG guidelines, and provide an understanding of how ADA noncompliance lawsuits originated. You&#8217;ll also learn how to broaden your market penetration by ensuring your web apps and sites are accessible to all.

      %h3 Consent and Ethics in Experience Design

      %p As we rapidly approach &#8220;The Uncanny Valley&#8221; of experience design, what obligation do technology creators have in maintaining an environment of informed consent and ethics with their audience? This session will explore the realities and impact that persuasive design techniques (both intentional and not) play into how participants engage with technology. 

      %p We will look at examples of efficient, devious, deceptive design, as well as well-intentioned design choices that may have unintended consequences. We will discuss the idea of consent as it relates to the people that interact with our interface, and how we can morally augment their experiences for the greater good without leaving them in the dark.

      %h3 Educating User Researchers: Using UX Skills to Design a Research Training Program
    
      %p Many people hoping to break into the field of user research don&#8217;t even know what skills are necessary to do the job and are missing fundamental concepts. They have to invest additional time and sometimes resources into gaining more skills, in addition to what they&#8217;ve already put into learning design skills they won&#8217;t use, and they have to rely on volunteer-mentors or companies to create apprenticeship training programs that vary wildly. 

      %p Some UX training programs for combine user research and UX design capabilities. This contributes to two problems: people aren&#8217;t appropriately trained in what they&#8217;ll truly need to do the work and to get a job in the field, and UX research isn&#8217;t respected as a discipline requiring specialized skills and knowledge. Training programs that focus on user research will give people the confidence to advocate for themselves and their expertise and, hopefully, encourage companies to recognize that not just anyone can whip out a survey or a usability test script and get back accurate, actionable insights that drive a better product.

      %h3 Make your Own Demands: Forging a Career Path in Content Strategy

      %p Now that some of the industry has begun to rally around the job title of &#8220;Content Strategist,&#8221; what does the actual job and career path look like? Why should we keep showing up and do the hard job, at scale? What are the challenges we all face, and when is some of this wicked ambiguity going to get cleared up? 

      %p In this talk, I consider the common challenges of a CS, the insecurities we battle, and how to sort out what to do when we&#8217;re faced with them. Drawing on my experience at Google, Twitter and Facebook both as a manager and as an individual contributor, I&#8217;ll share my worst mistakes, my best wisdom, and maybe some well-intentioned speculation.

      %h3 To Nudge or Not to Nudge? Designing Ethically with Behavioral Science

      %p Behavioral economics and applied data science have experienced a meteoric rise in the technology world, but just like the birth control pill, distance running and day trading, we have no real idea of the long-term impact of what we&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;ve seen some good stuff happen (DuoLingo) and a much longer list of technology that&#8217;s had truly undesirable effects on human interaction (Facebook, for shorthand on the subject).

      %p So, when is it okay to use this new understanding of how our minds work? What kind of data is it ethical to gather and use to predict what people will do? When should you use predictive analytics or algorithms to &#8220;help&#8221; people make &#8220;good&#8221; decisions? Who defines &#8220;help&#8221; or and &#8220;good&#8221;? And when it comes down to it, who decides when the organization you work for comes ahead of the people who use your service? 

      %p This talk will break down the broad categories of how behavioral economics and data science are influencing services today and describe the current, known impact of what&#8217;s being done. Then we&#8217;ll talk about how to determine when it&#8217;s ethical to &#8220;nudge&#8221; people and when it&#8217;s not, and finally, how to work with your team to develop a code of ethics and policies around data usage and &#8220;nudges&#8221; that you can use for transparency with your end users and your c-suite.

      %h3 Design Considerations for Building a Successful Intranet

      %p A successful intranet increases productivity and collaboration and it also contributes to a sense of belonging and engagement. However, as multiple content authors publish their content, it usually becomes difficult and frustrating to maintain unless we have a well-defined strategy in place.

      %p This talk, I will talk about content strategies that helped me overcome design challenges of working with big organizations. I will talk about how content strategy can help organizations to turn complex ideas into a simple digital experience, how to empower authors with content system and how to keep the intranet experience sustainable.

      %h3 Designing Health Systems For Group Encounters in Rural Rwandan Communities  

      %p 83% of Rwanda&#8217;s 12,000,000 population lives rurally outside of its main capital of Kigali. The Rwandan universal healthcare system was entirely built from the ground up after the Rwandan genocide as a way to address the health needs of all its citizens equally. This system, which is free to citizens, can successfully deliver quality healthcare at roughly $2 per person per year. It addresses the more immediate needs of the country&#8217;s rural citizens via an extensive network of healthcare centers and local community healthcare workers CHWs located in villages. Services offered at these clinics range from antenatal care, administering child nutrition programs, and diagnosing acute illnesses (including COVID-19 and malaria).

      %p E-Heza is a tablet application used by CHWs in some of these health clinics. The ultimate goals of the CHWs are to diagnose, provide routine and simple care, and ultimately refer complex patients to the better equipped regional health centers. E-Heza&#8217;s primary role is to document patient care, support decision making, and lastly replace a paper-based system that required significant cognitive load on CHW and health center staff.

      %p In this talk we&#8217;ll be addressing several topics:

      %ul.list-ul
        %li How do we adapt the participatory design process when we&#8217;re unable to have direct access with the users of our designs? How do we build relationships with local healthcare team members when we have to design across geographical and cultural lines? How does the local team aid the work and send feedback back up the chain to affect design changes?
        %li What does designing for a one-to-many healthcare interaction look like in terms of processing large segments of people and enabling non-clinical staff to make accurate medical decisions?
        %li Are there parallel challenges to designing for American healthcare systems and those of rural Rwanda and how might they be affected by assumptions of class and race?

    %p UX Camp: Home Edition will be 100% online and from where each of us are. And then, later, we&#8217;ll share on Vimeo so you can watch and learn again, watch what you&#8217;ve missed, or share with your internet pals.
