    %h2 Prototype Camp delivers a full day of bringing together people who are interested in putting a bit more &#8220;build and create&#8221; into their craft.

    %p Are you a designer who wants to learn more about how to code but have not yet found your inner codemonkey? Are you a developer who wants to learn more about how to create non-code prototypes but are afraid you just are not one of those creative types? Are you just curious to learn more tips, tricks, and techniques from other smart folks in the design and development community and Prototype Camp simply has not been offered yet?

    %p Have we got a day for you! Prototype Camp is going to bring together many bright minds who can walk you through a variety of methods for making things more made. Mark August 25th on your calendar, register, and come hang out with us.

In his 10 years of designing, coding, speaking, and writing, Jon has produced usable products and services for millions across the globe.

        %p Without the correct tools for fast and efficient HTML prototyping, even the best process can be deemed too expensive to attempt. However, the desire to be able to test one&#8217;s design in the browser, at a low cost is always the goal for experience designers. The HTML Prototyper&#8217;s Toolbox is a set of layout patterns and components, built on top of Twitter&#8217;s Bootstrap framework that NiceUX uses to create rapid coded prototypes.

        %p This session, Jon will teach you a pragmatic process and method to using the toolbox to create high fidelity HTML prototypes in the same amount of time you would spend with other prototyping methods. Simply knowing the basics of how front-end code works, we&#8217;ll be able to use the toolbox to create a prototype in 30 minutes.

        %p Brad is a user experience designer and researcher in St. Louis, MO. Over the course of his career he has helped clients in the financial, health care management, public utilities, and pharmaceutical management industries. He&#8217;s provided them with deep insight into their customers and users needs, and designed engaging experiences that were catered directly for those needs.

        %p Brad&#8217;s passion in user experience is centered around the modeling of data gained from user research and the creation of interactive prototypes and wireframes. He has presented on these topics at a variety of conferences. He also helps coach and mentor others who are new, or soon-to-be-new, to the user experience field.

        %h3 The Layers of Prototyping

        %p Prototyping is less about the tools you use and more about the process you follow. The process of prototyping can be broken down to three key layers&#8211;wireframing, screen flow, and state management. The completion of any of these layers is where a designer can stop, but as each layer is completed, the prototype gets closer to being a true representation of the final interaction design concept. By going through these layers one at a time, the overall complexity of the prototype melts away and the designer can take on the design one piece at a time. This is a process that has served me well in my career, and it has helped designers just getting into prototype tackle large and complex designs.

        %p The 6-8-5 Method can be used in a number of ways to help with ideation and brainstorming, but also for fine tuning your design. This session will focus on rapidly generating ideas in the form of rapid sketches around a set of requirements, then validating and fine-tuning them through structured pitching and critiquing. You won&#8217;t need a laptopâ€”just bring your favorite pencil and get ready to sketch!

        %p Providing clients with wireframe and design PDFs is common place. But those flat files generally aren&#8217;t very good at giving them a sense of what it&#8217;s like to use your awesomely planned site/app/etc. No matter what program you use to make your PDF there&#8217;s a quick and easy way to turn it into a prototype. In fact&#8211;We&#8217;ll make one in 20 min or less.

        %p And in turn you&#8217;ll help clients see the importance of wireframes in the creative process and help them to understand that the content and functionality drives the design. Not the other way around.

        %h3 InDesign &amp; Websites: A Compendium of Reasons it Works

        %p As an industry, we fall into habits like relying on software that may be antiquated. Responsive websites are evolving from rare into standard. The platforms users have to choose is ever-increasing in variety. The way we interact with a website today is different tomorrow.

        %p We need to reconsider our software for its strengths and weaknesses rather than rely upon what&#8217;s familiar for the sake of familiarity. As designers, we need to shake ourselves from habit and adapt.

        %p In this talk, we&#8217;ll cover reasons why you should use InDesign for web design, how to calmly explain your conversion to a developer, how to ensure your client doesn&#8217;t completely break down into pure panic, and other surefire ways to be the most interesting person in your office by being novel in your software choices. There might even be some talk about CS6 versus CS5.

        %p So you have a great idea for an iPhone or iPad app. But you lack the coding skills needed to bring it to life for testing and refinement before moving to development. Well a new set of features in Axure RP 6.5 allow you to rapidly prototype iOS applications for on-device testing with native-looking iOS UI widgets, home screen icons, splash screens, full-screen display, and swipe event detection. And all without writing a single line of code.

        %p In this session Will shows some of the techniques he used to create a demo iPhone app using some of the new features in Axure. You&#8217;ll learn how to simulate the user experience using dynamic displays, stored data in variables, multiple chained events, and more. For mobile user experience designers without ready access to iOS developers who can assist with prototyping, Axure provides a great way to get your ideas in people&#8217;s hands for design exploration and iteration.

        %h3 Testing Tools of On-Device Mobile Prototypes

        %p So, you&#8217;ve built your mobile app prototype&#8230; now what? It&#8217;s time to test, test, test. Mobile prototype testing is used to evaluate functionality and potentially uncover unforeseen points of issue prior to major development efforts. It&#8217;s also used to make necessary and recommended usability updates to improve the user experience. Conducting an in-person test session, a proven effective model, gives unique insight and means of interacting with the participants while observing their process in real-time.

        %p Similar to a favorite wireframing tool or text editor, there is a variety of approaches to conduct and capture your test session. In this presentation, we&#8217;ll review mobile prototype testing tools that range from straightforward to comprehensive. From bootstrap to enterprise testing software. From bending acrylic to forged 606 aircraft grade aluminum. In addition, Dan will walk through options and decisions made while building Manifest&#8217;s custom configured research facility.

        %h3 360 Prototyping: Learn to Look at What You&#8217;re Building from Every Angle

        %p Prototyping might be defined as applying a craft to learn about your product as you conceive and construct it. In order to learn more about your product (and what it can be) you want to look at it from all angles, not just the perspective you have inherited from developing your existing skills. In other words, designers, developers, and idea builders all benefit from being able to think about what they&#8217;re building using each other&#8217;s differing points of view.

        %p So how can you learn a new framework for conceiving of a product without spending years practicing a new craft?

        %p Research in the science of how people learn confirms that there are three different ways to pick up new perspectives and use them to inform what you create. In this session we will discuss these three pathways to 360 prototyping and everyone will get a chance to try on a new way of looking at what they make.
