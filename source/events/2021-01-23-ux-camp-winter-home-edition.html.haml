      %h3 Remotely Human

      %p Necessity is the mother of invention&hellip; and this year, have we had necessity! Many teams were suddenly forced to work entirely remotely, requiring major adjustments to work styles and tool sets. While most technology companies supported remote work to a certain extent, it&#8217;s been quite different to remove in-person possibilities completely. Gone are the casual water cooler chats, taps on the shoulder, work social events, and other interactions that can be the glue of strong working relationships. For those of us in the UX practice, we&#8217;ve also faced the challenge of conducting research from our homes, and running brainstorming sessions without post-it walls and collaboration space.

      %p Some of the adaptations in this time may stay OF this time when workplaces open up again. But which ones should we bring into the future? What have we learned about connecting while remote? What elements make us feel engaged and human? What tools have people used to fill the gaps? We&#8217;ll explore some ideas and approaches that may help us and our teams through this winter, and beyond.

      %h3 Design for Trust: Our Opportunity, Our Responsibility

      %p Cynicism is easy. Hope takes work. Trust bridges the distance between them, and designers have a unique opportunity to foster it. In today&#8217;s economy, we need new strategies to earn trust and help consumers and citizens alike make more confident decisions. But undermining confidence is cynicism: it erodes trust in the media, government, science, and consumer brands. To regain trust, we&#8217;ll go beyond the buzzwords of empathy, transparency, and authenticity. Drawing on examples from publishing, retail, government, and beyond, we&#8217;ll discuss how a new framework for content and design can empower people and renew their confidence—and even strengthen society itself.

      %h3 Remote Digital Ethnography: Understand Online Dating Behaviors Within the Digital Environment
      
      %p Observing participants can present several challenges, yet still turns out invaluable data that informs our designs—so how in the heck can we observe thoroughly while still maintaining a remote posture? The digital layers of a users&#8217; ecosystem interact to impact their experiences in user experience research today, ethnography should combine the physical and digital planes to understand multiple influences on any one interaction.  

      %p In online dating, there are many contextual elements to consider, including: virtual profiles, messaging, filters to find appropriate matches, use of multiple competitor apps, and geolocation, which create the user&#8217;s online environment. The UX digital landscape combines the context of the physical world plus in-app environment and connected ecosystems. The user&#8217;s environment is primarily digital. The surrounding world is just one plane/layer of consideration in these interactions and digital ethnography can help us understand how to design for these different layers of experience.

      %h3 Usability: The Subset of UX

      %p UX and Usability are two words that are often used interchangeably and without much regard to their differences. Since usability is an important aspect of UX, we need to understand the differentiation, and make sure that those around us understand, as well.

      %p We&#8217;ll evaluate the similarities and differences of UX and usability, and help make sure we&#8217;re all able to communicate them effectively. It&#8217;s valuable to not only understand what makes a product or service usable, it&#8217;s also important to know how to evaluate usability using standard heuristic principles.

      %h3 Revisiting Wireframes &mdash; Techniques &amp; Principles for the Whole Team

      %p Wireframes are not only design artifacts, they are also effective communication tools. Learn how wireframes can be used in multiple ways throughout the product design process to ensure that user goals are clear, many ideas are explored, and developer hand-off is more seemless.

      %h3 Rapid Prototyping in the Design Process

      %p No one likes spending hours of time on a well thought out design, only to learn that the idea behind the design wasn&#8217;t backed by user feedback. Creating with a prototype mindset makes it easier to create quickly, without the added anxiety of thinking you will need to crumple it up and throw away later.

      %p Rapid prototyping is quick, often rigged workflows built for the purpose of proving or disproving an idea or assumption. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that design and rapid prototyping are two very different things. When you think design, you think pixel-perfect, time consuming layouts. 

      %p We&#8217;ll work through how these two very different actions play an important part in user experience design. Learn how rethinking your approach to usability sessions as a rapid prototyper will allow you to either prove or kill an idea in record time.

      %h3 Leave a Trail of Breadcrumbs: Designing Navigation with Customer Intentions
      
      %p Navigation in complex websites and products is&hellip; well, complex. How do you help your users go from A &#8594; B &#8594; H when you&#8217;re putting an intricate product line online or managing thousands of pages within a digital ecosystem? We believe that answer lies in designing for customer intentions. 

      %p In this session, Lis and Diana will cover why designing for customer intentions throughout your digital ecosystem empowers your team to build a bridge between what customers need and what your business provides. We&#8217;ll dive into how to design an organic flow that carries the user through your site with intuitive ease rarely found in more traditional, hierarchy-heavy IA structures.

      %p Many teams miss these important steps in their rush to implement new designs, leaving users confused, and business stakeholders frustrated. Come ready to jump in!

      %h3 8 Ways People Screw Up Their UX Portfolio
    
      %p Portfolios are required for designers, researchers, strategists, and managers. Yet, most people in our field do not want to show off their work. In many respects, we do not understand the essentials of a killer portfolio until we see it. In this session, Ian Fenn will explain the essentials of your portfolio. He will give practical tips and tricks to make sure you show the best version your &#8220;self&#8221; in your portfolio. In addition, Ian will explain the importance of treating your portfolio like a product that you design.

      %h3 A Digital Designer&#8217;s Carbon Footprint
    
      %p Designers may be inadvertently contribute to climate change through their normal, everyday activities. As digital designers, we use a lot of resources and since many of them are digital we tend to overlook the impact we can have on our environment. 

      %p We can change our behaviors, practice sustainable design, and reduce our carbon footprint by practically applying behavior change, which is definitely part of our role as designers. A lot of conversations about climate change give a very zoomed-out view where the individual level contribution is completely discarded. We&#8217;ll discuss ways to change our behaviors and have an impact on climate change as individuals.

      %h3 Your System is a Language
      
      %p Software development, component-oriented design, and content strategy practices all emphasize the idea of building a &#8220;shared vocabulary&#8221; to make communication between team members easier. But a vocabulary implies grammar, context, and more&hellip; What can we learn about our content models and design systems by taking the metaphor of language seriously?

      %h3 Think Like a Developer to Design Better Structured Content

      %p If you work on websites from the ground up, you know the pain of seeing your best-laid content plans go awry. Hasty help text, mysterious CMS constraints, and unclear user stories can turn even the sharpest strategy into a sad site. 

      %p When you plan structured content with the mindset of a developer, you can avoid more confusing pitfalls from the get-go. Time will be saved, and you&#8217;ll ensure developers can use your work, and plan richer content, empowered with a clear understanding of what&#8217;s possible.

      %p In this session, you&#8217;ll learn:

      %ul.list-ul
        %li Why to put on your &#8220;data glasses&#8221; when planning content
        %li How to write user stories that resonate with an end-to-end team

      %h3 Don&#8217;t Let Ambiguity Be the Death of Your Design Project

      %p It seems like everything is fast-paced and we don&#8217;t always have the luxury to get all the answers we need before we start diving into our design process, which can be frustrating—if not paralyzing! Dealing with ambiguity is part of the design process, and yet it can feel overwhelming every. single. time. Even worse: the more we climb in our careers, the more it seems we&#8217;re expected to be experts at everything, and context switching between.

      %p Gathering information, or just enough information to get started, is a key element of success in the design process. We&#8217;ll explore different frameworks to help you understand and identify risk tolerance, decision-making techniques, and how to keep moving while still reaching outcomes.

      %h3 Unpacking Context During a Pandemic: Reflections &amp; Tips

      %p Context has always been of importance to unpack and describe when understanding human realities. Context is anything and everything that brings meaning to human realities. Pre-COVID, qualitative researchers readily presented options for studies for both in-context and out-of-context approaches. 

      %p With the onset of the pandemic, in-context approaches posed challenges: increased study expense and safety risks to assess. The need to elicit context understanding remains&mdash;but without the ability to immerse in it&mdash;how do we as researchers understand it? An absence of context understanding can affect a researcher&#8217;s interpretation of the human story and reality. This in turn can affect the knowledge applied by a design team. 

      %p Meena Kothandaraman of twig+fish will share four observations from recent projects in which participants engaged in a way that revealed more contextual detail. Every project was run remotely&mdash;but each time the research team noted approaches that allowed the participant a chance to think of their context and articulate it with more specificity. These approaches are easily applied and will be still be applicable post-pandemic.

      %h3 Mapping the Journey of a Design Career

      %p The User Experience field is an infinitely rewarding one that has no shortage of serendipities, fears, risks, wins and losses. My story is one of fear and bravery, bravery and fear, all told from the fresh perspective of a designer who is convinced she is just getting started.

      %p How do you design a career you&#8217;ll be proud of? How do you turn constraints into advantages? These are the questions I want to explore as I talk about my own journey into UX from traditional design. From past failures to wake up calls and personal reinventions, I&#8217;ll map out this human&#8217;s journey so far.
