    %h2 Speaker Camp helps you get ready to present at conferences. Spend your Saturday with us and get prepared to get on stage and show your smarts!

    %p You don&#8217;t need to picture people in their underwear to get up on stage and share what you know. You do, however, need to have a compelling idea along with a well-written abstract and a well-structured, well-prepared presentation in order to give the talk you–and your audience–deserve.

    %h3 You&#8217;ve Got A Lot To Say. People Deserve to Hear It.

    %p Show up with 5 minutes of a presentation and learn from seasoned professionals who have seen their fair share of stages. We&#8217;ll provide you with a safe, welcoming environment and help you by providing valuable and actionable feedback that will help you level-up your presentation game.

    %p We can help with that. Come learn with us!
