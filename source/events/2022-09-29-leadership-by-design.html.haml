        %strong Leadership by Design 2022

    %p On Thursday &amp; Friday, September 29th &amp; 30th, from where ever you are. Since we&#8217;re not going to be in our space, let&#8217;s meet in yours! We&#8217;ll have 2 days of stellar keynotes and focused design leadership presentations with thoughtful Q&A that allow you to gain a lot of insightful learning. In addition,each day has an uplifting interstitial that provides a nice break.

    %p Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago-including all of these wonderful speakers. We&#8217;re used to amazing views, great coffees, too many snacks, and a lot of local Chicago-area food goodness. Since we can&#8217;t do that we&#8217;re going to postpone our full sessions until 2023.

      %h3 Stage Zero: What to Know When Starting a Design Team from Scratch

      %p Congratulations! You&#8217;ve accepted a job where you&#8217;ll have the great privilege of leading design at a company the way you&#8217;d like to lead it, by building a team the way you&#8217;d like to build it&hellip; for a company that has never worked with designers. 

      %p During this talk, I&#8217;ll share the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from my experience during the last decade of building three teams at three very different organizations. I&#8217;ll describe what to expect as far as ups and downs of the challenge you&#8217;ve just accepted, and will provide a playbook to help you and your team find success. Additionally, I&#8217;ll provide tips to help you select the right company to join in the first place.

      %h3 Growing Better Design Careers

      %p One of the biggest challenges to retaining employees is the lack of value or growth they perceive in their current position. To solve this, design leaders need to provide a clear understanding and path for career advancement that is based on outcomes and objective skills. This means designing a system centered around a growth based mindset which:

      %ol.list-ol
        %li Defines job descriptions that are skill and outcome based rather than based on subjective qualifications
        %li Establishes a Career Progression Framework with team roles aligned around  defined outcomes and professional growth based on individual needs and learning styles.

      %p Pairing these two concepts together helps leaders that manage teams large or small, made up of specialist or generalists, or teams that are just getting started or have been established for some time. In the ever changing world of employee retention and workplace dynamics, design leaders can help position your teams for future growth and meet your designers where they are at to better layout what kind of future they want.

      %h3 Ethics &amp; Trust for Emerging Technologies

      %p Emerging technologies such as automated vacuums and smart refrigerators are becoming more common in homes, and we all find ourselves conversing regularly with chatbots (whether we want to or not!). As these systems augment humans at work and at play, design teams are challenged with managing the complexity of the interactions, and need to ensure that humans are kept safe and in control. Unfortunately, ethical statements such as &#8220;do no harm&#8221; are simplistic and unhelpful when designing complex interactions. 

      %p Carol will introduce practical approaches that integrate ethical design principles; engage teams in speculative work to proactively identify bias and harms; and help you and your team to focus on supporting users in gaining calibrated trust of these new systems. Strong leadership and facilitation skills are needed to guide teams through these often uncomfortable discussions. Be prepared to guide your team successfully through this important work.

      %h3 Inclusive Design Leadership: Beyond Human-Centered 

      %p As technology increasingly becomes a conduit for meeting our basic needs&mdash;from finding love or taking care of our health to buying groceries and booking travel&mdash;it is becoming clear that technology is no longer neutral. How the technology works can be either a force that perpetuates cycles of exclusion and inequity, or it can carry the torch of equity and inclusion.

      %p In this presentation, Liya will discuss living up to our mission as &#8220;user advocates&#8221; for all of our users, no matter their race, gender identity, age, or socioeconomic background. She will also explore strategies to embed inclusive mindsets into the design process and help organizations realize the full potential of human-centered design.

      %h3 And Now You Are a Leader&hellip;
      
      %p You&#8217;ve been promoted, you have the role you&#8217;ve been working towards for the last 2-5 years in design leadership. Now, what do you do?

      %p Mags Hanley will take you through the four main decisions to establish your &#8216;right&#8217; design leadership; your leadership style, the most effective projects to focus on, recruitment, and strategic relationships.

      %h3 Yoga &amp; User Experience: What Accessible Yoga Can Teach Us About Creating Inclusive Spaces

      %p The goal of yoga accessibility is to create physical practice spaces and experiences that are safe, diverse, equitable, and inclusive for all. But for some, such as those in larger or differently abled bodies, or those in marginalized communities, access to the foundational practices of yoga—breathwork, meditation, and asana—remains out of reach.

      %p And so it is with digital spaces.

      %p The work we do in digital information spaces is key to bringing digital experiences to life. How might we apply lessons learned from yoga accessibility to create safe digital spaces that are open to a diverse population, and that are equitable and inclusive for all?

      %p In this session, we will cover:

      %ul.list-ul
        %li Holding space: Refocus your listening to identify and become present with a diverse user base.
        %li Inquiry: Ask three simple questions to help zero in on user needs, and to facilitate information wayfinding.
        %li Sequencing: Use structure and flow to build engaging experiences.
        %li Variations: Learn how modifications and variations invite belonging and prevent &#8220;othering.&#8221;
        %li Non-attachment: Release preconceived notions, prejudgement, and biases to move beyond diversity to normalization.

      %p This talk will appeal to UX practitioners seeking creative ways to incorporate accessibility, diversity, equity, and inclusion in a unique and relatable way.
