        %strong Leadership by Design 2022

    %p On Thursday &amp; Friday, September 29th &amp; 30th, from where ever you are. Since we&#8217;re not going to be in our space, let&#8217;s meet in yours! We&#8217;ll have 2 days of stellar keynotes and focused design leadership presentations with thoughtful Q&A that allow you to gain a lot of insightful learning. In addition,each day has an uplifting interstitial that provides a nice break.

    %p Normally, we&#8217;d all be heading to downtown Chicago-including all of these wonderful speakers. We&#8217;re used to amazing views, great coffees, too many snacks, and a lot of local Chicago-area food goodness. Since we can&#8217;t do that we&#8217;re going to postpone our full sessions until 2023.

      %h3 Stage Zero: What to Know When Starting a Design Team from Scratch

      %p Congratulations! You&#8217;ve accepted a job where you&#8217;ll have the great privilege of leading design at a company the way you&#8217;d like to lead it, by building a team the way you&#8217;d like to build it&hellip; for a company that has never worked with designers. 

      %p During this talk, I&#8217;ll share the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from my experience during the last decade of building three teams at three very different organizations. I&#8217;ll describe what to expect as far as ups and downs of the challenge you&#8217;ve just accepted, and will provide a playbook to help you and your team find success. Additionally, I&#8217;ll provide tips to help you select the right company to join in the first place.
