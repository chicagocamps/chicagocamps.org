      %h3 Baby Shark: Leveraging Organizational Politics for Design Team Success

      %p It can be a struggle to make the practice of design truly influential. Between engaging with engineering methodologies, negotiating the boundaries of design ownership with product management, and arguing for the value of design-led business decisions (not to mention managing their own people), design leaders find it difficult to gain ground for their team.

      %p There are approaches you can learn from and/or use to train your team to detect and leverage underlying organizational systems by tuning in to competing goals and process nuances. Armed with this&mdash;and a healthy sense of collaboration and allyship with other groups&mdash;your sharks can achieve influence in their own right and magnify yours.

    - content_for :talk_emileigh_barnes do

      %h3 Your craft AND your influence
      
      %p To be effective, to be inspiring, to drive results, leaders need a strategy for building and maintaining relationships.  As practitioners, we spend our careers perfecting our craft. Until the day we&#8217;re promoted to a &#8220;leadership position,&#8221; and suddenly craft expertise isn&#8217;t enough to get things done. 

      %p Of course we still need our skills. And we need organizational influence just as much. Good work alone doesn&#8217;t speak for itself, as rarely does speaking for yourself alone.

      %p It&#8217;s that right balance of craft and influence that is the difference between becoming Paul Revere and becoming William Dawes. 

      %p Who was William Dawes? 

      %p Exactly.

    - content_for :talk_karen_vanhouten do

      %h3 A Method for the Madness

      %p When confronted with challenges, whether professional or personal, we often ask some variation of this question: &#8220;How do I do [this scary, difficult, yet necessary thing] without actually having to experience any discomfort or take any risks?&#8221; As a speaker and design leader, I get asked some version of this question every time I give a talk or work with new team struggling to change.

      %p Obviously, the answer is: you can&#8217;t. There is plenty of discussion right now of the necessity of getting comfortable with discomfort, but very little actual guidance on how that process works. Instead, we hear tales of transformation that follow a vague formula of initiating events, challenges faced, victories won. These stories can be inspiring, but beyond that, they don&#8217;t provide much help for people struggling to take the leap out of their comfort zone. Without any practical guidance, many people hesitate and wait, static and stagnant, choosing to be careful instead curious.

      %p I&#8217;ll outline a step-by-step approach for pushing outside our comfort zones and expanding our experiences. I&#8217;ll start by contrasting the perception of how our comfort zones serve us with the very different reality of how they work against us. I&#8217;ll blast through the most common excuses we have for staying put versus moving forward. We&#8217;ll explore simple, tactical ways to push through our resistance, move past our fears, and nurture the courage to design better relationships and make more authentic choices, in our careers, and our lives. 

    - content_for :talk_todd_zaki_warfel do

      %h3 The Design Career Journey

      %p Everyone wants to hire great talent. But how do we define great? Does that change over time? How do you know you&#8217;re recruiting and hiring the right people? How do you retain and develop talent, giving your team meaning, purpose, and ownership? 

      %p In the Design Career Journey, we&#8217;ll explore a framework for recruiting, retaining, and developing top talent—including the common question of &#8220;Should I go into management?&#8221;
