      %h3 Building Creative, Collaborative Cultures
      
      %p Organizations are taking a strong interest in design &#8212; realizing that understanding the needs, expectations and contexts in which people interact and use products and services leads not only to improvements in their current offerings, but ideas and opportunities for new innovations. With this realization has come immense investment in design talent and training. But having design talent and creativity does not ensure success. Design is not just a new tool to add to a growing collection. As these skills and individuals are added to the mix in many teams, both designers and non-designers alike often struggle to work together and produce great work.

      %p Design is a shift in mindset that influences how we behave and make decisions. In order for organizations to make use of design they must be set up to do so. In this presentation we&#8217;ll look at the characteristics and cultures of organizations that are able to effectively create, collaborate on, and produce great design and explore strategies to foster innovation by building better teams, helping them use new tools to work together, identify problems and break down silos that stop progress.

      %h3 A Human Centered Approach to Talent Acquisition

      %p People are the foundation of great organizations. Yet when it comes time to invest in the process of finding and vetting the right people to grow and develop our organizations, too many times it feels like a chore. How do we bring joy and a human centered approach to this process? Amanda will show examples of collaboration and experimentation that have helped the team at 18F to double in size in a year. 
    
    - content_for :talk_amy_cueva do
      
      %h3 Purpose Driven Design

      %p How can we work together to deliver meaningful change? Design is an invitation to change. It helps us get from where we are to where we want to be. Although empathy has achieved buzzword status, it is a philosophy, not a trend. This talk will explore how empathy can inspire our direction as individuals, fuel purpose driven business innovation, and even guide us to make change at the societal level. New twists for integrating empathy into our work will be evaluated and discussed.

      %h3 Designing for 1600 Penn.

      %p Get a behind-the-scenes look at how innovative design is able to happen in-house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Ashleigh will show-and-tell how her small design team transformed daunting challenges into successful digital campaigns. Hear her team&#8217;s tactics for tackling limited resources, overcoming impossibly quick timelines, experimenting while in the public spotlight, and not just taking criticism, but intentionally seeking it out.

    - content_for :talk_cennydd_bowles do
      
      %h3 Ethical By Design

      %p Every business is now unique in their faith in experimentation, evidence, and iteration. Done right, it&#8217;s a healthy, focused approach. Done poorly, it becomes twisted into absurd scientism: numbers trump all, and users are reduced to mere statistics.

      %p Digital technology&#8217;s unprecedented scale brings serious ethical responsibility. How can we balance data-driven approaches with empathy and humanity? How do we help companies see users as more than means to achieve company goals? And how do we ensure our decisions benefit not only ourselves but our wider communities and the world at large?

    - content_for :talk_ian_swinson do

      %h3 Careers by Design

      %p We spend a great deal of time talking about design language, design tools, and technological developments and trends, but relatively little on planning and nurturing our careers. Maybe this gap is because there is not a good &#8220;language&#8221; to help us talk about career planning and aid in managing these discussions.

      %p Ian has been working on a framework to help employees define, design, monitor, and grow their careers. The primary goal of the framework is to establish a broad set of guidelines to assist managers as they support employees. It is useful for people who want to focus on one core skill, as well as those interested in more multi-disciplinary roles or (eventually) management.

      %h3 Org Design for Design Orgs: Building and Managing In-House Teams

      %p As organizations continue to establish and mature their in-house design teams, it turns out there&#8217;s very little common wisdom on what makes for a successful design organization. Books and presentations tend to focus on process, methods, tools, and outcomes, leaving a gap of knowledge when it comes to organizational and operational matters. 

      %p In this talk, Kristin Skinner will share her personal experience as a design leader who is driven by the challenge of organizational design. She will share stories on the benefits and challenges of working in both consulting and in-house, and will leave you with practical tips to build and lead your design teams and organization.

      %h3 Fear is a Liar

      %p Writing is the connective tissue that creates understanding. We, as social creatures, often better perform rituals to form understanding one on one, but good writing enables us to understand each other at scale. So we&#8217;re going to talk about writing.

    - content_for :talk_randy_hunt do

      %h3 Fireside Chat with Randy Hunt

      %p Shay Howe will, along with the Prototypes, Process &amp; Play audience, interview Randy Hunt to learn more about design and design leadership at Etsy.

      %h3 Frameworks of Feedback

      %p Design and code reviews, retros, and performance reviews &#8212; all acknowledge the importance of communication and feedback and they are a good start. But they don&#8217;t tell you how to give negative feedback or ensure that you, as a teammate or manager, hear the small things before they become big things.

      %p Let&#8217;s talk about feedback and examine frameworks for how to ask for and frame feedback effectively. Not all situations call for the same type of feedback and some are more sensitive than others. We will look at Non-violent communication, techniques from family and marriage therapy, as well as more traditional frameworks for feedback.
