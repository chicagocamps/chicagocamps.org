Howdy folks!

We&#8217;re busy getting all the things updated and doing some housekeeping from our 2016 events.

While that&#8217;s happening, we wanted to let you know that we know our schedule for next year, and it looks like this:

<ul class="list-ul">
  <li><strong><a href="/events/2017/ux-camp/">UX Camp</a></strong> &#8212; Saturday, February 11th</li>
  <li><strong>TBD Camp</strong> &#8212; Saturday, June 3rd</li>
  <li><strong><a href="/events/2017/prototypes-process-play/">Prototypes, Process &amp; Play</a></strong> &#8212; Thursday &amp; Friday August 10th &amp; 11th</li>
</ul>

Feel free to <a href="/proposal/">submit a talk to UX Camp</a> or purchase tickets to UX Camp and/or Prototypes, Process &amp; Play. (Really great early rates right now!)

Thank you for your continued support! We look forward to bringing you more high-quality events in 2017!
