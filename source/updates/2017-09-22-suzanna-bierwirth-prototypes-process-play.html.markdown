## Suzanna Bierwirth &ndash; Lightning Talk

#### Chief Creative Officer of The Mars Agency

Consumer-first through-the-line thinker. Empowering Leader. Passionate Business Builder. Mother. Maker. Instigator.

Raised and educated as a visual artist in Germany, I am relentless in my pursuit to make work that is meaningful, memorable and beautiful. I am left and right brained, and continually deploy both art and science, to create programs that engage consumers, change minds and evoke behavior. I believe there has never been a more exciting time to be in marketing. I love that we have to move faster and be more intuitive and inventive than ever before. And with the lines now blurred between all disciplines and channels, I know anything and everything is possible.

#### Managing Up, Down &amp; Sideways

Congrats–you finally got promoted! You&#82217;ve gotten your seat at the table and now you&#82217;re learning that it&#82217;s no longer just about the work. It&#82217;s also about the politics within your own organization and the clients. These tips are what I have learned over the years–from Junior Art Director to Chief Creative Officer–and none of them involve kissing ass or sucking up. It&#82217;s all about empathy.

**Suzanna Bierwirth:**

I managed to become the CCO. &ndash; I think anybody here that isn&#8217;t managing, ask yourselves if you really want to become a manager. And I&#8217;ve seen that mistake over and over. That I promote people &ndash; I&#8217;m going to promote you. And they get all quiet. I don&#8217;t want a promotion. I don&#8217;t want to become a manager. 

`[Laughter]`
 
&ndash; And making everybody better. He said okay, I can do that. &ndash; So Russ asked me to give some hard core tips. So I wanted to start with how you&#8217;re going to manage yourself once you are a manager. &ndash; From now on everybody is going to judge you on how your team works. And do your team a favor and &ndash; you got to let it go to help them get there. And sometimes it&#8217;s really hard to train people. Because in the end you will be judged by everything that comes out of your team. So again delegate.

And then the first thing I think &ndash; more responsibility, managing people is find the core team, your inner circle. People you can totally trust. You need somebody who can call your bullshit. Somebody you can fully trust. 

&ndash; I took over, the first thing I did, I trained them. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about it. They know how I work. And then the last thing is don&#8217;t change yourself. Don&#8217;t think you have to be perfect.

Don&#8217;t change that. Just perfect that. &ndash; If you are a project manager, don&#8217;t think &ndash; Don&#8217;t waste your time on trying to be someone you&#8217;re not. Take what you are, make it work, and perfect yourself. Does that make sense? &ndash; How much time do I have? 

**Moderator:**

Ten minutes.

**Suzanna Bierwirth:**

Okay. Manage your people. Managing your people is the most fun. You got to know why they are there &ndash; 

The second one is, yeah, the last one is actually &ndash; it&#8217;s your responsibility. So if your team doesn&#8217;t meet the deadline &ndash; because you don&#8217;t give them enough resource to make the deadline. &ndash; E‑mail. How do I want to receive information? &ndash; to think about. Not memos this is how I want to receive information. It&#8217;s never going to happen.

And the last one is don&#8217;t leave me hanging. I have a boss, too. If some bullshit happens, get to me right away. I like texts. If something happens, send me a text. So I can tell my boss when my boss comes into my office and says &#8220;What the fuck.&#8221;

`[Laughter]`
 
I already have ideas on how we can make it all better. The next one is don&#8217;t come crying, oh my God, I don&#8217;t want to do something. Just come to me and say &ndash; information, are we going to do this or that. I don&#8217;t know if we should do this or that. What do you think? That helps me a lot better than you coming and dumping a whole load of shit on my plate. Because it would be nice if &ndash; so I can help. 

Russ, isn&#8217;t that true? Are you testing if she can understand my accent? 

**Moderator:**

She&#8217;s okay. 

**Suzanna Bierwirth:**

I always get the weirdest messages on this translation. So no problem with our solution and no surprises ever. But then the other one that I noticed is when you come to me or when I go to my boss, I kind of have a plan. I don&#8217;t just go there. And what do you really want to have happen when you go there? Like last week I went to &ndash; and there were more people. &ndash; and I would have gotten nothing. So what I did is I went and &ndash; there was so much more that we could do for this client. But I don&#8217;t have enough people. Oh my God. Did you run it through finance? Of course I ran it through finance. We&#8217;re using X‑amount of dollars. &ndash; 

`[Laughter]`

And I said &ndash; I made him feel really good about himself. &ndash; always make them feel it was their idea. I know I should fight that. Just dealing with it. 

Those are my management tips. And do I have time for questions? 

**Moderator:**

Two questions. 

**Suzanna Bierwirth:**

Two questions. Anybody? 

**Moderator:**

Is that what they call a shit sandwich? 

**Audience:**

Nice haircut. 

`[Laughter]`
 
**Audience:**

So my question is how do you get feedback as &#8220;the boss.&#8221; Because I&#8217;ve been in situations where my boss has asked me for feedback and it&#8217;s hard to navigate the right feedback and the right tone. How do you have confidence that you&#8217;re getting feedback as a leader, a manager, sort of higher up in the food chain? How do you ensure that you&#8217;re getting?

**Suzanna Bierwirth:**

Giving or getting?

**Audience:**

Getting. It&#8217;s harder to get feedback.

**Suzanna Bierwirth:**

Feedback from my boss basically.

**Audience:**

Or from your team.

**Suzanna Bierwirth:**

Well feedback from my boss because I know what my boss is up against. I know what keeps him up at night so I know why he is saying what he said. Feedback from my team, I have my trusted advisers that I know when they&#8217;re telling me I did that wrong. I trust them. 

You have to earn that trust. But there is always a little bit of truth. So I do think we are &ndash; So my team set me down. 

**Moderator:**

One more question. Anybody? Okay. 

**Audience:**

When you talk about people &ndash; do you have advice on how to find the right balance? 

**Suzanna Bierwirth:**

What I do is I tell them something that they might not know how to do &ndash; actually enjoy doing. And I don&#8217;t try to persuade them. Unless it&#8217;s completely stupid. Why not? Everybody wants to try &ndash; But what I see is people &ndash; 

I&#8217;m done, right? 

**Moderator:**

You&#8217;re done!
