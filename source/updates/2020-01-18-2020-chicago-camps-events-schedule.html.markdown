We&#8217;re still working out the schedules and the content, however, we&#8217;ve got great starts and expect to have some announcements for you very soon! 

We&#8217;re really excited, and we can&#8217;t wait to see you this year. Don&#8217;t delay&ndash;<a href="/proposal/">submit proposals</a> to the UX Camps so we can help get you on stage!

Also, don&#8217;t miss out on the ​<strong>Extreme Early Bird™​</strong> tickets for <strong>Leadership By Design&ndash;they&#8217;re only $250 each for the first 10 tickets</strong>, or until the end of January (whichever comes first).

As always, thanks for helping us make these events great! We look forward to seeing you all throughout 2020!
