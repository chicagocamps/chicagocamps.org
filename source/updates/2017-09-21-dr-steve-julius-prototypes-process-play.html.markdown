## Dr. Steve Julius &ndash; Presentation

#### Founder and Chief Executive of HRCG and former Team Psychologist for the Chicago Bulls

Dr. Steve Julius is the founder and chief executive of HRCG, a Chicago based firm specializing in executive leadership, high performance teamwork, organizational effectiveness and strategic human capital solutions. A true proponent of the power that is derived from integrating diverse talents and points-of-view, Steve has built a team of professionals who combine the approach of trusted advisor with the first-hand knowledge and insight that comes from their having been in significant leadership positions prior to joining HRCG.

Steve believes that personal and professional success is the result of principled intention, consistent practice and skillful execution. As such, he maintains an active practice of advising senior executives and their teams from an array of major corporations, entrepreneurial companies and professional service organizations. He also serves on the advisory board for several private equity firms. Whether called upon during times of organizational transition or in anticipation of capitalizing on opportunities for enhanced business performance, Dr. Julius is known for his ability to combine his knowledge of human behavior, organizational dynamics and business strategy to create relevant and practical solutions. Steve&#8217;s enthusiastic, outcome oriented style has been described as &#8220;contagious&#8221; resulting not only in ready-to-use business solutions, but also a collective sense of personal satisfaction and empowerment on the part of those with whom Steve works.

#### Getting a Seat at the Table and Keeping It!

Design is now finding it has a seat at the leadership table, but is it/are you viewed as a practitioner of an arcane science that is called upon to facilitate business processes? Or, are you also routinely called upon to contribute to the overall business strategy at the company–wide or departmental level? Building strong, domain capability will maintain your status as a design expert, but it won&#8217;t lead to your being trusted as someone who can help build the overall business strategy. That requires a complementary set of skills.

Talk to any CEO in organizations small and large and she will tell you about the critical role technology—and design–play in that business&#8217; success. Ask that same CEO to describe how the design functions contribute to the day-to-day operation and it&#8217;s likely she will describe an enabling or support role. Dr. Steve Julius will describe how you can contribute to significant value creation as a strategic business partner, while maintaining and even enhancing your status as a design expert.

**Dr. Julius:**

Well it&#8217;s good to meet everybody. First of all, I could get up here and say ditto to everything Jay just shared. I couldn&#8217;t agree more with what she shared with you. Just simple literal reasons can make a world of difference. 

I was very lucky to grow up with a mom who went to college. And she was told to get married. And I&#8217;ve been married to a person for almost 44 years who is my business partner. And the kind of harassment and abuse that she had to go through. And frankly she could be up here talking to you today. Because what she endured these years goes way beyond. &ndash; The Chicago Bulls, they used to say stick to your shrinking. Just do the shrinking work. Don&#8217;t tell us how to run the organization. &ndash; Change people&#8217;s attitudes and their expectations of who I was and what I brought to the table in order to have &ndash; I&#8217;m assuming that most, if not all of you would like to be considered more than just a designer. More than just a kid &ndash; More than just a female. 

To get a seat at the table, I think it&#8217;s critically important &ndash; medical center. &ndash; and how to handle that. And trying to improve the process. &ndash; Because he touched so many aspects of what was the source of tension &ndash; Well guess what? And the message I wanted to share with you, what I came up here to talk to you about is how you can have a seat at the table. &ndash; We assume that people have some kind of overt gender &ndash; Ask questions. It tends to elevate our character with a relationship and a perception of us that is different. Does that make sense? 

How is this? Better? &ndash; Okay. So I&#8217;m here just to share with you some basic ideas &ndash; Requires persistence and requires patience. And it also requires a realistic optimism.
