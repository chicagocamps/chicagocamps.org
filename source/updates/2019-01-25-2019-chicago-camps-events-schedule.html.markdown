Howdy Chicago Camps friends! 

2019 is upon us and we&#8217;re super excited to share our schedule for this year with you. As you may know, we have &#8220;<strong>Camps</strong>&#8221; which typically are 1-day mini-conferences on a Saturday. In 2019, we&#8217;re going to have 2 of these&mdash;on Saturday, April 6th and Saturday, October 12th, following the &#8220;Spring&#8221; and &#8220;Fall&#8221; model of 2018.

In addition, we also host an annual design leadership conference. We <em>used</em> to call it <strong>Prototypes, Process &amp; Play</strong>. This conference typically has happened in early August on a Thursday and Friday and that&#8217;s worked really well for us (and a lot of you! However, the name, well, it didn&#8217;t quite land where we had hoped. 

It was definitely different, and although we let everyone know it was &#8220;design leadership&#8221; in nature, the name tended to communicate something much more at the practitioner level. Those who know us, and the event, generally understood and were kind enough to nod politely at us about it. Those who know us really well let us know we were missing the mark pretty solidly!

We&#8217;re excited to announce that this year, on Thursday and Friday, August 8th and 9th, we&#8217;ll be launching <strong>Leadership by Design</strong>! You may be familiar with Prototypes, Process &amp; Play, so think of it as a renaming of that event, with some added cool stuff. The programming for PPP was truly all about Leadership by Design, by designers, for designers, and by and for anyone. It was time for us to have a conference that was named appropriately and helped identify itself clearly and concisely. 

<strong>Leadership by Design</strong> will have the same great food, snacks, and content you&#8217;ve come to expect&mdash;<strong>with additional content on Wednesday, August 7th, because we&#8217;re adding workshops!</strong> We&#8217;re still working out the schedule and the content, however, you can rest assured that this year will be a great year, with great, inexpensive options for you to keep your skills current and to help you level-up!

We&#8217;re really excited, and we can&#8217;t wait to see you, so without any delay, here&#8217;s that schedule, along with links to the event pages so you can <a href="/proposal/">submit proposals</a> to the Camps and purchase tickets (and get in on those Leadership by Design tickets while they&#8217;re only $200 each!).
