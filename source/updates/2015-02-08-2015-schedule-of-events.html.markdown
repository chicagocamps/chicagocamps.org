In August, we&#8217;re working with Columbia College to host <a href="/events/2015/prototypes-process-play/">Prototypes, Process &amp; Play</a>, a full, 2-day conference teaching design leadership skills, and for the Chicago Camps price you&#8217;re used to. Our pricing is rock bottom, starting at $250 for 2 days of presentations that are all of keynote worthiness all on their own. Get your tickets fast&#8211;we&#8217;ve only got 20 tickets at the $250 price, and then the rate goes up to $275! Tickets are limited, so get yours today to ensure you get to take part in this amazing event!

Thank you for helping us continue to grow and bring our high-value, low-cost events! We look forward to working with you in 2015!
