## About Fred Beecher

<a href="http://nerdery.com/people#fb" rel="nofollow">Fred Beecher</a> has been working in User Experience since 1998. In that time he&#8217;s seen UX mature from a field struggling to prove its value to one driving an explosion of innovation and economic growth. To help feed the ever-increasing demand this explosion has sparked, Fred designed and implemented the UX apprenticeship program he currently manages at The Nerdery in Minneapolis, MN. Fred is an established contributor in the UX world. In 2007, he authored the first official Axure training program, which he ran until 2012. He has written numerous articles and blog posts on prototyping, iterative design, and UX career development, and he has spoken on these topics at design conferences worldwide. His face is also covered with pie.
