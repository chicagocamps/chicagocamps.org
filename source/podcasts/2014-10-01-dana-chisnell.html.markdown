## About Dana Chisnell

<a href="http://www.usabilityworks.net/" rel="nofollow">Dana</a> strives to counter bad data every day. She&#8217;s a research nerd (her words) who just loves methodology, collaborating, and data &#8211; especially data she can help teams use to make design decisions. In fact, Dana loves applied research so much that just for fun, she sometimes organizes clients, friends, and other nerds to do flash research on the weekends!

Dana believes in ending the opinion wars. And she has helped dozens of teams at organizations large and small find peaceful cooperation as they gather and analyze user research data to inform designs from software, to websites, to apps, to voting systems.

She&#8217;s what you might call a &#8220;seasoned professional&#8221; who, with Jeff Rubin, wrote Handbook of Usability Testing, Second Edition.
