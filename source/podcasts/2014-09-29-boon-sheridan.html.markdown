## About Boon Sheridan

Over the last twenty years Boon has had job titles like site producer, content specialist, information architect, interaction designer, user researcher, stage manager and voice-over actor. Between bouts of title whiplash he&#8217;s helped build some very big things, and lots of very small things &#8211; each with their own powerful lessons. He&#8217;s a Product Designer at NASDAQ OMX, a Rosenfeld Media expert, a lover of new cocktails and old records. He&#8217;d love to swap stories over a beverage.
