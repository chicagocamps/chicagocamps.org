## About Jenn Downs

Jenn Downs is a UX Researcher and adores the web and what it can do for the world. She got her start in tech as MailChimp&#8217;s first hire and has recently joined up with the Atlanta photography/tech company ShootProof. Jenn is also a mentor for Code for America and invented the slightly awkward, yet truly helpful, Laptop Hugging Method for remote mobile testing.

Outside of being a web nerd, Jenn owns and runs a carpentry business with her husband, dotes on her dog Dickie, is a songwriter, and plays bass and guitar in a few bands around Atlanta.
