## About Nicole Maynard

<a href="http://www.nb-studio.com/" rel="nofollow">Nicole Maynard</a> is a Lead Interaction Designer at GE Capital creating solutions that improve the way commercial lending teams work and use data to manage their growth. She got her start in graphic, information and interaction design and had been performing user research well before realizing it was an actual thing. Her work has been published nationally and has won various design awards.

Nicole has recently taken the helm as the president of the Chicago chapter of UXPA (User Experience Professionals Association) and is a purveyor of health and nutrition. She has a possibly unhealthy love of birds, but don&#8217;t ever tell her that.
