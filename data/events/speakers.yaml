    <p>She likes to speak in public and will go just about anywhere if you pay her expenses.

Some of her most recent presentations include speaking at South by Southwest 2019 and TEDxMidAtlantic on Surviving as a Change Agent, at SXSW2018 on avoiding the Mediocrity Trap, and on Critical Thinking at SXSW 2017. Recently she has spoken: to US Treasury officers on Diversity of Thought; to Canadian Federal senior executives about Diversity of Thought and Rebel Thinking, to the California STEM Education conference 2020, at the Business Innovation Factory 2017, and multiple times at GovLoop&#8217;s NextGen Leadership summit.</p>

Unlike traditional approaches to org design that focus on charts and work distribution, Eli emphasizes studying the way people interact with an organization as a product. Using this as a tool for reflection leads to better interactions between people and their work cultures. In re-examining Design Thinking as a organizational design tool, with a focus on diversity and inclusion, their work has generated some powerful new ways of looking at old questions in a new light. Eli enjoys playing video games, blogging, and volunteering on the side.</p>

I&#8217;ve been doing more work in Interaction Design and Information Architecture but in the past I have done UI development as well prototyping (HTML, CSS and Javascript) that is eventually ported over to whatever the client&#8217;s end system is utilizing.
    <p>In 1999 I discovered Improv while living in Chicago, starting classes at Second City. Improv taught me how to be more aware of the moment, how to listen more instead of just responding and that a group working together in a non-judgmental and supportive manner can create much greater things than any of those individuals could on their own.</p>

    <p>Milissa Tarquini is VP, Product UX and Design for Food Network, HGTV, DIY, and The Travel Channel &#8212; which are conveniently owned by one company that no one has heard of: Scripps Networks Interactive. She began her career in 1995 (gasp!) as a designer at Aol (another gasp!) and designed her way up the ranks until she was the Director of UX for all of Aol&#8217;s 85 content sites and mobile applications. After she realized how insane that was she left to join Scripps where she focuses on bringing great entertainment and utility experiences to the fans and users of awesome brands. She is extremely lucky and giddily proud to have had her work used by millions of people every day since 1995, a fact that she sometimes forgets when she is fussing over something ridiculous like the way the light falls on the cupcake in that one photo. You know the one&#8212;it&#8217;s weird right?</p>
    <p>Milissa does all of these things by hiring an amazing team and getting the hell out of their way. Unless they are trying to get that cupcake photo by her.</p>
