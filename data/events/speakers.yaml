My role is varied depending on the what the project needs. I&#8217;ve been doing more work in Interaction Design and Information Architecture but in the past I have done UI development as well prototyping (HTML, CSS and Javascript) that is eventually ported over to whatever the client&#8217;s end system is utilizing.
    <p>In 1999 I discovered Improv while living in Chicago, starting classes at Second City. Improv taught me how to be more aware of the moment, how to listen more instead of just responding and that a group working together in a non-judgmental and supportive manner can create much greater things than any of those individuals could on their own.</p>
