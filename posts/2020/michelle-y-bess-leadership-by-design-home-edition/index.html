            <p>Michelle Y. Bess opened Leadership By Design: Home Edition with her keynote “Yes Racism Exists: Now What?” Enjoy! </p>
            
            <p>​​​<em>The following transcript may contain typographical errors. Please forgive any mistakes!</em></p>
            
            <p>Thank you so much for having me here again. My name is Michelle best, I use she, her pronouns. And today, do you have the next in the wake of the murders of Briana Taylor, Tony McDade, George Floyd and many others, this then on full display that racism exists today in 2020. And two questions that I’ve heard a number of times over the last several months is, how did we get here? And now what do I do?</p>
            
            <p>Thankfully for you, I recently did a presentation with two of my colleagues, Christian Rice and Chris Cote, that people found really helpful in reminding us of the history of racism in the US, so I’m gonna do a quick history lesson on system racism in the US, and then I’m gonna share some ways that you can actively work against racism at your company, one of the best ways to think about systemic racism is as a business, the businesses vision is maintaining white supremacy through seamless integration with sexism, classism and faces them.</p>
            
            <p>When we shift from the vision to the mission of the business, we see its core mission of creating economic, political and social systems that are designed to extract all of the value from one racial community and give it to another black woman, 2-50% more likely to die from child birth and white women, because when people, including doctors and nurses look at black women, they do not see the same level of pain and empathy, black men, 2 50% more likely to die from police violence than white men, despite being less likely to have weapons on them, because of people, including police officers and the 12 people sitting on a jury and look at black men… They do not see the same level of empathy. Black children are 339% more likely to be suspend different schools for the same behaviors like children, because when people, including teachers and principles… Look at black children, they do not see the same level of empathy. In places like Minneapolis, were these protests seemed to consistently start… Black men or 70% more likely to experience police violence, and black children are 800% more likely to be suspended.</p>
            
            <p>Where we’ve gotten it wrong is that white supremacy isn’t about people walking around like Hitler youth, it’s about slowly chipping away at your empathy for black indigenous people of color, also known as IPAC folks and other underrepresented groups, so that you don’t care when society from us is still giving to you throughout the course of history, the strategies and tactics change with the mission of taking much and giving little.</p>
            
            <p>When I did this presentation with Kristen and Chris, Chris told him, incredible story about this better that I wanna share with you today.</p>
            
            <p>The younger brother didn’t finish college, and he started working at Taco Bell when he was in high school, and quickly worked his way up the ranks to being a general manager, and for a half a decade, the consistently won awards for the highest sales volume store in the state doing millions of dollars a year, it was of course, one hour as crappy pay, and he wanted and needed a change, and since Ed overseen Talabani to digital and mobile ordering, Chris suggested he applied for an entry level customer support job at the company.</p>
            
            <p>So they worked together updated as resume prep for the interview, but when the hiring energy use, he decided he was not worth talking to, that one common… Sometimes you’re just not a fit, but what I think is interesting is that about six months ago, so the brothers told a mate or and grill, he was working at part-time that he would make the restaurants food for free, if the owner also let him run his own path, a restaurant out of the kitchen, whose does not a free labor. Right, so the business began. Recently, Chris learn that his brother’s business was doing more sales in a day, a paid at entry level tech job in a week, based on recent sales numbers, he’s on track to do half a million to a million in revenue in his first year as a restaurant in the midst of a global pandemic, he was able to do this because he’s been half a decade committed to managing service operations in one of the most hostile environments, to learn, as a 30-year-old man has better, was willing to give millions of dollars worth of service operation knowledge to a company in exchange for step back into an entry-level job, systemic racism had taught him to give much and expect that.</p>
            
            <p>I share this as a reminder because under representative Blacktown specifically looks a lot different than than other talent because it has been forged in an alternate reality that many people don’t know that it’s now exist and cannot even imagine in businesses like many of hours across the world, black people are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and more likely to receive negative performance reviews from their peers and managers, so when we as individuals and managers make decisions through that envies, instead of taking a step back to better understand why we think perceiver act the way we do towards our black co-workers, we’re doing harm to the company, we’re doing harm to the companies growth and harm to ourselves, we’re missing out on incredibly smart, dedicated innovative talent, we’ve spent a lifetime as black people learning how to succeed in hostile territory and bipod folks are uniquely positioned to innovate and persevere through challenges, so next, I’m gonna walk you through what those challenges have looked like over the last three centuries, the Three of black people in America helps to explain why Chris’s brother this so much in expected little and I think it really answers the question many people have asked me of how did we get here and what led the unrest of the last several months.</p>
            
            <p>The white supremacy is maintain through systemic racism in a number of ways, including policing and brutality, widening the wealth gap and ensuring black people do not receive quality education, what people were given their freedom between 18… 63, when the incision Proclamation was signed on June of 1865, and June of 1865, enslaved people in Texas were finally told that they were free, around that time, the 13th Amendment, it… You’ll see at the top of the slide, Crete 13th Amendment was created, making slavery illegal except as a punishment for a crime, and then come better at monuments were erected, a regular reminder to black people that not everyone wanted them to be free, the KKK and Lynch moms also gained popularity in the 1800s with Lenin’s becoming family entertainment.</p>
            
            <p>In 1840, cotton produced right, and LA people made up 59% of U-S exports, but black people did not receive any of that money, so the 1800s set the stage to further the wallet with the implementation of Black Code, continuation of slave codes already in place. Black Codes restricted and criminalized black behavior activity and political rights, through that criminalization, black people were sent to prison at high numbers, we saw the creation of convict pleasing renting prisoners to work, and a huge less of wealth was the class of the Freeman savings think due to mismanagement and fraud that collect collapse led to a loss of 57 million and today sellers of black wealth.</p>
            
            <p>And in education, throughout the 1800s, it was illegal for enslaved people to be educated or learn to read or ranked, in 1896, the US Supreme Court upheld the belief of separate but equal through Plessy versus Ferguson and enabling black and white people to learn but separately in very different environments, what the black learning environments being sub-par.</p>
            
            <p>Moving into the 1900s, the brutality continued in the murder of motel on the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, which killed four young black girls between the ages of 11 and 14 years old, for… In the 1800s, we saw President Clinton past the crime bill, which gave 30 million to militarized the police and sensitized making steps that disproportionately impacted black people.</p>
            
            <p>The wealth gap was impacted again by Jim Cross, Jim Crow laws which hindered political and economic games or black people, they made it legal to not higher blacks. They were black. Black Wall Street in Tulsa, Loma was bound by the local like community and more professions with no repercussions, and recent research that I just learned about indicates that black patents and innovation were impacted by the fear of this massacre and still the black people around the nation.</p>
            
            <p>And one of the greatest winners of the wealth gap was fdr’s New Deal, and the creation of the FA…</p>
            
            <p>The New Deal created an opportunity for white families to receive mortgages and to purchase homes, home ownership is one of the greatest ways to accumulate well, and black people were kept from that opportunity through red lining.</p>
            
            <p>It’s continued to be sub-par as a result of a number of things, including the red lining I just mentioned around versus Board of Education was passed in 1954, which declared racial segregation unconstitutional, both red lining and Brown versus Board though led to white flight or a… If players with all the wealth and at one help to fund public education, this light left black people in neighborhoods as fled that have now last property value and thus have lower property taxes to go towards their schools, and at the neighborhood was not impacted by white flight the red lining by the make banks marked our neighborhoods as bad and not fit for loans, and thus were never invested in the first place, and at the end of the 1900s, Clintons crying Gosford, the War on Drugs, further criminalizing black communities, but in police in schools and feeding the belief that young black people are super structures… We’re only aerial… We are only 20 years into the 2000s, but so many videos have been recorded of the murders of honor and black people reminding us we are not safe, as recently as June black men were found hanging in trees in California. Modern-day lynching, there was an attempt to close the wealth gap through the Community Investment Act, intended to listen.</p>
            
            <p>Well, at protons and Bill, well, unfortunately, the loosening of those restrictions allow for predatory lending, which disproportionately impacted black people, and thus in the Great Recession of 2007, many IPAC individuals lost their homes and any equity along with them.</p>
            
            <p>And then lastly, with education, the No Child Left Behind Act had high aspirations and really great intentions, but in practice, that led to an increase in high six testing and move the US education system, quality and accessibility and closer to polarizing… To a polarizing system that penalize low socio-economic schools with alarming results, those students are 300% more likely to be up suspended as punishment, that’s the mental framework at a young… It should be punished and creates the school-to prison pipeline.</p>
            
            <p>The privatization of these presents means that young people who should be from… So he also, a long periods of time, the vision of maintaining white supremacy and perpetrating systemic racism has seen iterations over the 400 years, I highlighted three areas, but we didn’t get to healthcare, voting rights, the Bodo security in many other ways. The business of racism has profited on black bodies… Of racism is real.</p>
            
            <p>It’s alive and well today, and that’s because racism is a business, what we’ve experienced recently is not just about one individual injustice, because we can not compartmentalize the experiences of black people, all these events… Everything you see is connected. The history I just shared impacts all the parts of our lives in the US, and that’s why I wanted to start with it, and it doesn’t just impact the US, it impacts our companies, our companies are a microcosm of our country, this history and systemic racism doesn’t go away when we come to work, when we leave meetings, when we’re coaching our employees delivering performance reviews, or when you are creating products, the business of racism has been woven into every part of our lives, and it’s part of our day-to-day work to… So are you in the business of dismantling racism or benefiting from it?</p>
            
            <p>I know many of you wanna be allies, alles IP as a verb, it requires us to do more than say, I’m not racist, it requires us to be actively anti-recess so that we do not continue to see black people murdered and given less than we deserve, and I’m going to assume that because you’re here, you’re in the business of dismantling racism, so thank you, and you wanna know how you can dismantle it at your companies and implement an effective di-strategy along with your team.</p>
            
            <p>I’m happy to share with you some of the things that we’ve done it proud to dismantle resist and build an equitable company.</p>
            
            <p>Okay, cause areas a little bit out of order, but we’re going with it, so I’m sure many of you have heard about sprout before.</p>
            
            <p>But let me give you a quick overview of who we are. We are a software company who started here in Chicago, and it sons expanded to Seattle, Ireland and blended… And many other countries across the globe.</p>
            
            <p>Our social media management tools are used by businesses to better communicate with their customers and vice versa, where else… Many of people who care very deeply. And we care deeply about our customers, our employees and our families, these are some of the other things that we care about at sprout, these are our core values, and up there, you’ll notice that one of our values is to champion DEI, and lastly, like many of you you’ll see that last one it… That last bullet point, we… You can tell by our Loro wall installation in our Chicago office, which I haven’t seen in a very long time. And in fact, look where I said We were hashtag office goals.</p>
            
            <p>So I’m gonna talk to you a little bit about sprout because we’ve built a really award-winning culture, as you can see, some of the icons that I have up on the screen, and an important step for all of you to consider and building this culture, your cells, is to ask your company what it is that they want and what they need, similar to when you’re creating a new feature or product for a customer, you… The research, and then you create it or create what you think they’re actually asking for, this way you’re dating what’s priority, and I am a… The hardest part about the… I is not saying you care, I think most of us would say that We care, the hardest part is deciding to commit, but once you commit… There are so many ways to go about doing the work.</p>
            
            <p>My hope is that at least a few of the things I share can be implemented at your companies, but I will encourage you to remember that you should only do what makes sense for your company and your context.</p>
            
            <p>So one of the first steps that we took and implementing RDA strategy at Prout is being able to determine why anti-racism and DI are important to you, why it was important to ask, and what you believe the benefit is to the business articulating that. Why is important because you build trust and credibility, if you can articulate your Y by pocket, under-represented people will not trust you, and you’ve lost the battle before you either the gun. And two, I found that many points of connection is really critical to weaving a DEI commitment into the fabric of your company, so it’s important to your why as it relates to your company, your customers, your community, and how you can differentiate yourself from your competition.</p>
            
            <p>And I imagine for some of you, you’re already committed to do your leaders on forward, and so what you can say to them is that once you determine your why, it can lead to increased revenue and performance, an increase in customer intimacy and an increase ability to recruit what your wife is… And it is authentic.</p>
            
            <p>The next thing he had was, if you will relate to this with designers on the call is we had a radical imagination, and this is something that my friend Xavier-my talks about all the time.</p>
            
            <p>We have to have a radical imagination, we are a generation known for being on the cutting edge, we have taken the old and transformed it into something they’ve never seen or even considered a possible… You all are making those products, and when we hear people talk about what is necessary to bring on the new front here, we hear things like, Do the thing that scares you.</p>
            
            <p>Break boundaries, innovate, try something new, pitch lines, get out of your comfort zone, you all regularly to come sit with complex problems, get uncomfortable in order to take things to that next level and ultimately create things that change the way we operate in our company and in the world, when we develop a new product or a feature, we start with a big bold idea and then we figure out how to make it work, but when it comes to our DEI efforts, we wanna be comfortable, many companies want di efforts to feel good for everyone, so we’re okay with the status quo. This often means when someone proposes an idea for D I… We hear all the reasons why it.</p>
            
            <p>I let work instead, re-sponsor conferences, march and parades, hire some BI-pack and people and women, ’cause we don’t like when people challenge us on our values or push us to really do something to make a change, but we must start thinking about our DEI efforts in the same way we think are about our product work, start big, start bold and make it work.</p>
            
            <p>The next thing we’ve done it sprout is we focus on equity, many teams are really struggling with making movement on DI, and that’s because one, we don’t wanna be uncomfortable, as I just mentioned, and two, we’re solving the wrong problems.</p>
            
            <p>Most companies are wanting to work on the issues of diversity and inclusion, and it’s rough, we argue that your focus should be on ELA, your DI work should not be comfortable. Comfort will inhibit your efforts FAR WITH THE… Okay.</p>
            
            <p>We describe a sprout, we describe equity as system-level change, system level changes, tackling the root of the problem, which is equity, and going beyond the symptoms, which are diversity and inclusion. So for us, that wasn’t just saying that women and people of color didn’t afores, that’s a diversity a problem, it was us taking a step back and asking why, Why weren’t we able to build a pipeline of women and people of color?</p>
            
            <p>And what we realized is that we were closing our jobs on our website and with our VCs and our funders, and according to the applications that we received, most of the people who were going to those websites were white men, so women and IPAC individuals were not even finding out about our jobs, which is not totally fair, because clearly some women and people of color, we’re going to those sites, but what did they see once they got there, and what we realized is that some of our job descriptions used language that wasn’t inclusive, and the format to create… And because we focus on systems, we identified that our system for one posting jobs and to drafting the job description needed to change, that is equity, which should not be confused.</p>
            
            <p>The quality is that everyone gets the exact same thing, so going back to my example, if everything is equal, you could say that the exacting access to that job description because it’s online, everyone should have access to the internet or a computer, but this assumes that everyone has access to that computer and internet, and we know that is not true. Research shows that people of lower socio and one classes often don’t have that access, and that those groups often include by pack individuals and non-binary people, if your recruitment process is equitable though not just giving everyone the exact same thing, you go… A necessary step further, you post your job still on your website and with your VCs, and it means that you’re attending a recruitment bear, so you can get one-on-one interaction, you’re not just relying on the internet, and you go to recruitment fairs in different neighborhoods or go to new schools, are you partner with organizations that serve the populations that you want to connect with, equity means you give or do more to meet folks where they’re at and provide what is necessary. Not the exact same thing as you can see in this image with the bikes, a quality at the top, everyone has the same thing, equity really tailoring it to what people need.</p>
            
            <p>Another illustration, and this is one of my favorites by Angus McKie, and I like this one because he includes the reality panel, which you see on the right inside, and this I think really explains why we have trouble making progress on gender and racial equity, because when the reality is, what we see on the right, getting to a quality on on the left hand side is already hard enough, let alone getting to that equity panel right in the middle.</p>
            
            <p>It’s important to note as a company that when you shift to equity though, you have to be prepared for some pushback because when you’re accustomed, the quality feels like oppression.</p>
            
            <p>What do you provide the resources and support that some people don’t have as a result of the history that I shared earlier, so it requires meeting people where they’re at, getting power and privilege to all and creating more power and spaces. Heer.</p>
            
            <p>Alright, so let’s move in the hiring, which is what many people often ask me about, a foundation, set the stage by determining our wines, having a radical imagination, focusing equitable systems and asking our employees what we want, what they wanted. Once we did all of that, we heard from our employees that what was really important to them was related to and… And I have to say that our recruitment team at Prout is incredible, and they iterate on our hiring processes, regulate, in order mitigate bias and ensure that our process is equitable. So I know, I’m sure you know and have experienced a differentiation of having top talent, so you know it’s important to recruit with purpose in order to attract a diverse workforce, but in case you need some research to back that up or you need to share it with your leaders, a couple of things that you can cite Forbes insights, identity diversity inclusion as a key driver of growth.</p>
            
            <p>Harvard Business School found that having multi-cultural social networks increases diversity, but despite those benefits, I often hear from founders and small companies that they don’t have time to prioritize DEI in recruitment early on.</p>
            
            <p>And when I hear this from leaders, and if you hear from your leaders, I encourage you to cite the study from the American Journal of Sociology that underscores the flaws and a delayed approach, the results suggested that an already homogeneous organization will tend to become even more homogenous as it scales up, it’s part of why the big companies like Google and Facebook have a hard time making impact despite investing millions of dollars and tons of time, then when you don’t leave DEI into your DNA early, it’s hard.</p>
            
            <p>Course correct.</p>
            
            <p>A few other numbers, research has shown that wouldn’t increase gender and racial diversity by 1%, you can see revenue increases of three to nine percentage points, things that if you increase gender diversity by 1%, you’ll see a 3% increase in sales revenue.</p>
            
            <p>If you increase racial or ethnic diversity by 1%, you can see a 9% increase in sales revenue, that is huge. Those are huge, huge numbers.</p>
            
            <p>So knowing the benefits of a diverse team at Sprout, we first wanted to have a solid and equitable Foundation which… But you on conscious by a training, and beyond that, unconscious by training across the business, we also do a root pressure with our time, ikot and role.</p>
            
            <p>The next thing that we did as part of our foundation, as we drafted these impact job descriptions, which we learned about from Lever-based in the Bay, and so I’m sure many of you have jacked job descriptions and you have created those job descriptions that have 20 plus bullet points, right?</p>
            
            <p>I know I have… And I’m sure you also have hired people who did not match all 20 of those bullet points, and when we think about the statistic, this is a generalization that men typically apply for jobs when they are 60% qualified, and underrepresented people typically apply for jobs when they are 100% qualified, having a job description that is qualifications that are not necessary means we may be missing out on some really great candidates.</p>
            
            <p>So in order to make our process more equitable, we edited our job descriptions to communicate the impact that our employees would have over on the 6 and 12 months, and it also communicates what the person’s growth will look like, which is really important to folks right now, growth in that first year, and in doing that, that forces are hiring managers to determine the must-haves and the nice-to-have before they ever post our job description.</p>
            
            <p>The next thing that we did was develop rubrics. We start… All of our… We have, in our interview processes, we use behavioral-based interview questions, as I’m sure many of you all do the questions, let’s say… Tell me about a time when those kinds of questions, but we’ve created rubrics for those questions so that every… Any interviewer who participates in our process knows what a great good and a poor answer sounds like, so we’re all evaluating based on the same standards, and as we develop an interviewer trainer for all of our interview participants, participants to go through this training explains the structures we created to bring equity and mitigate bias, and ensures our teams know our hiring philosophy, the interview process, and are informed about our applicant tracking system is.</p>
            
            <p>Okay, so we did those three things and a number of others, but the next thing that we did after building these equitable systems was that we needed to fill that pipeline with really great candidates, including folks that align to our priority identity groups at sprout.</p>
            
            <p>So we have built intentional and authentic relationships by identifying community partners that are aligned to the groups we wanna support, and if you’re Chicago, some of those groups that we partner with, our Howard Brown health rework training ago scholars and Black Girls Code.</p>
            
            <p>What I know many companies are not hiring, and that does not mean that you can’t build intentional networks right now, I argue this is the best time to be cultivating Canada, your… And encouraging folks to intentionally build their networks during this time, go on LinkedIn, look at the diversity of the…</p>
            
            <p>You’re not… So I’m the RA of you here now, this is the time to… Thank you, Ross.</p>
            
            <p>By build, this is the time now to really build those really those authentic relationships before any of your roles even open up, heard a little bit of push back from people when I suggest these intentional… These intentional relationship building, and that’s because people felt really uncomfortable, they felt uncomfortable with building their network in this way, and so this is a reminder that all you’re doing is networking with people, you’re connecting with people who you think are interesting or aligned to the experience that you need on your team, and they just so happen to be by pack, it is okay to prioritize hiring people of color because we’ve ignored our responsibility to do so for so long, building those relationships right now allows you to connect with candidates like Chris’s brother, who you might overlook in at a time and then a process when you’re trying to move really quickly, your ability as leaders to attract and retain talent is really critical, it correlates to your success as a leader and your ability to build strong teams, so to engage diverse talents, whatever diversity means to you, it’s important to think beyond diversity of that I already talked about and showed some stats on how important gender and racial diversity are, once you expand beyond that definition, then you have to mitigate bias and your process using some of the ideas that I shared so that strong canids are the ones that are getting through that your process based on their merit, and lastly, consider other systemic changes you can make offering flexible work models, benefits and incentives that attract divers and under-represented talent.</p>
            
            <p>Which brings us back to the beginning of engaging diverse talent and make sure you include those folks in your hiring process, each of these steps, each of these pieces all reinforce one another, that many of you are not hiring right now or… And that you may not have diversity on your teams… That’s something else I hear. That’s okay.</p>
            
            <p>That’s okay right now.</p>
            
            <p>What, everybody the… Oh no, be up front when you’re talking with people and then communicate the commitment to DI that you have a hiring manager as a company and what you’ve done to date.</p>
            
            <p>Okay, another thing that we did early on at sprout was we established some ambassadors for our D-I work, DEI work can not be done by one person or even a few people, route, the folks that work on the…</p>
            
            <p>You are an and people manager and middle managers, and our executives direct reports to the CEO, that’s part of what makes us so successful as representation across… All up, right here, you’ll see our SCP of Global Sales, Ryan Barreto, and next to him is our CFO, the… The both of them are involved in our DEI efforts.</p>
            
            <p>Alright, I know that was a lot on high it. I’m gonna shift to something that many of you probably already have in place, and that’s on-boarding, when you onboard a new team member, you’re helping to introduce them to your culture, talking about your values, orienting them to your team and to their work.</p>
            
            <p>That is an active inclusion, you’re not just throwing them to sink your slim.</p>
            
            <p>So it’s sprout, we do Coonan model, and this means that everyone starts with a group of people, and they get to departments, geographies and levels right away. That’s been really effective for us.</p>
            
            <p>Employees then spent almost two weeks together learning about our product and benefits, talking with leaders of the art business units, doing T-lunches now obviously, and meeting with members of their team, what I’m wanting to understand how their work might overlap. Another part of our onboarding is that as of recently, we have a three-part series introducing DI to our new hires, the first step of the series introduces our DI priorities and resources right away, and part online unconscious bias module. And that part of the lesson is that we do a live session to debrief the online learning and prepare people for their first di-Gil meeting, which I’ll talk about last.</p>
            
            <p>So after this session, I encourage each of you to consider what you can take away from what I just shared and include in your own onboarding process to make it even more inclusive than I’m sure it already is.</p>
            
            <p>Okay, so I talked you through really the employee life cycle so far, if we talked about recruiting, collection, onboarding, the next question is, what do we do with these people? They join a team, the… That have helped us build systemic change across our culture, and the first thing that we introduced was so meeting learns to support inclusion, some examples are creating agendas for every single meeting that we’re having, identifying a note-taker, identifying a robot advocate when we were in the office, and then, as Russ mentioned, for us, being mindful about participation, if you talk a lot, we ask people to step back and let other share, and if you don’t speak much, we ask people to step up and share their perspective.</p>
            
            <p>A really great activity that you can do as leaders related to the participation is to pay attention to who gets interrupted in your meetings or who gets credit for ideas. When I’ve had leaders do this in the past, I ask them to just track it, open up your notebook and literally tally to interruptions, who ideas are attributed to, and more often than not, that people hold be interacted or under-represented folks, and the ideas get attributed to men.</p>
            
            <p>Okay, I love this little photo of one of our little ones at sprout, the next thing we know is that our employees had a life before coming to sprout and have one outside a rout as we’ve all been able to witness during coved.</p>
            
            <p>My nephew is not here today, so you don’t hear a three-year-old running around in the back, but again, we asked our employees what they wanted it, and one of the things that we heard is that people wanted their families to be included in their work, and as a DI-practitioner, that is not something I would have ever thought about. I was focused on racial equity and women in tech, because we asked our employees, we were able to identify a high a way to build inclusion in our culture, so now we have out kids day Which sprout Halloween for little or little ends. We were doing happy hours after our All Hands and we had to bring your family to Work Day, which was really fun.</p>
            
            <p>Clearly, we don’t know what that will look like in the time of Cove, but our team is super creative, so I’m excited to see what they come up with.</p>
            
            <p>And lastly, a huge and critical part of our culture sprout is our monthly di Guild meetings that I mentioned earlier, the work of Di as changed management, changing minds, hearts and behaviors, which can only be a companies of trust, it makes space to educate and learn together once a month at the same time, and everyone in the company is invited to attend our first session about four years ago, have 30 to 50 employees who attended, and now we get over 400 employees across all levels and geographies as an East month.</p>
            
            <p>These sessions are planned by some of those ambassadors I mentioned earlier, so members of our exec team, our directors, individual contributors, they all come and work together to create these sessions, and so far our team has talked about identity voting rights, the model minority myth, systems of oppression and we hosted panels of our black and LGBTQIA employees, and while these meetings are great, I really wanna emphasize that no one thing that I shared today makes the difference for us at sprout, what makes the difference for us?</p>
            
            <p>And we’ll make the difference for you too, is going back to why is at earlier committing to the work, to working with people across the business, and three, doing a number of high impact initiatives at the same time that matter to your people and your company. So use what you heard and make it work for your context or do something totally different.</p>
            
            <p>So as I wrap up, but I hope you’ll take away from today’s presentation is that one, you have to commit an order to whole heart at, you have to commit whole-heartedly to this male or am time, you have to iterate on your hiring using the data and everything that you learn next, it’s critical to have ambassadors and they have to be representative people at all levels of your company, and lastly, it’s really important to create a culture of inclusion, and one way to do that is through onboarding.</p>
            
            <p>I started off this talk. I ask me if you were in the business of dismantling racism or benefiting from it.</p>
            
            <p>The business of racism plays out every day in our companies, it’s insidious. Today, I shared strategies that have worked for us, it’s route to build equitable systems, helping to dismantle century is a systemic resume in our companies and in our lives, I look forward to seeing and hearing how you will dismantle racism alongside us.</p>
            
            <p>Thanks.</p>
